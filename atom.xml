Only then can they lend the necessary assets on the target chain. The fees accrued by the Radiant V2 protocol are distributed in the following manner: 60% is apportioned to dynamic liquidity providers (dLP), 25% to the depositors (Lenders), and the remaining 15% is designated for DAO-controlled Operating Expenses Wallet, of which the use will be governed by a future on-chain proposal.</p><p>By using Radiant, users can place assets like ETH, WBTC, or other related collateral on Arbitrum, and then borrow BNB on BSC, effectively leveraging their holdings. During this borrowing procedure, users are exempted from any cross-chain operations, meaning there’s no need to transfer assets from one chain to another, such as from Arbitrum to BSC, in the example provided. This feature simplifies the user experience, enabling cross-chain or Layer 2 lending activities without having to physically move assets between different chains. Radiant also offers a unique one-click loop function that allows users to enhance the value of their collateral by utilizing automated cycles of deposits and loans. </p><h3 id="Radiant-v2"><a href="#Radiant-v2" class="headerlink" title="Radiant v2"></a>Radiant v2</h3><p>In Radiant V1, the cross-chain operations were predominantly facilitated through Stargate’s cross-chain routing mechanism. One of Radiant v2’s first priorities will be to move ERC-20 RDNT token to the <strong>LayerZero OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)</strong> format. This migration will make cross-chain fee sharing much more seamless, enable quicker launches on additional chains, and permit native ownership of bridging contracts rather than relying on third-party bridges.</p><p>In its V2 version, Radiant has introduced Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP) to tackle the inflation problem associated with the RDNT token. With this change, users only making deposits will only be eligible for the basic interest rate, excluding them from RDNT token rewards. To qualify for these rewards, they must lock in dLP tokens equivalent to at least 5% of their total deposit value. For example, If User 1 deposits 1M USDC into the Radiant market but has zero of dLP tokens locked, they would be eligible to receive a base deposit yield but <strong>would NOT</strong> be eligible for RDNT emissions. On the other hand, if User 2 puts 1M USDC into Radiant and has $50,000 worth of RDNT/BNB dLP locked, this user <strong>would</strong> be eligible for RDNT emissions (assuming the minimum 5% threshold continues to be met).</p><p>Currently, Radiant offers two locked LP (Liquidity Provider) pools:</p><ul><li>Arbitrum: Balancer with an 80/20 composition (80% RDNT &amp; 20% ETH)</li><li>BNB Chain: Pancakeswap with a 50/50 composition (50% RDNT &amp; 50% BNB)</li></ul><p>dLP tokens currently support lock-in periods ranging from 1 to 12 months, with the corresponding token incentives increasing with the length of the lock-in period. Auto-relock will also be added as an option. The earned token rewards will be linearly released over a 3-month span. During this time, if users do not wish to wait, they can apply for early exit with a penalty, allowing them to obtain between 10% and 75% of the token rewards, as shown below.</p><p>To improve the ease of use, Radiant added zaps for virtually every component introduced in v2: adding liquidity, looping, and adding dLP — there is even a zap to loop + deposit 5% dLP all at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.gi1suwh34j4.webp"                      alt="Utility Flow Chart"                > </p><p>Radiant has innovatively introduced Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP) to its platform, transforming the way depositors can earn RDNT token rewards. This new feature necessitates depositors to contribute a specified proportion of liquidity, consequently boosting RDNT’s demand and locked-up volume, and enhancing its overall liquidity. This strategy not only promotes the appeal of RDNT but also aligns with the interests of medium to long-term liquidity contributors, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between them and the platform.</p><p>In a move towards long-term sustainability, Radiant, in its V2 version, has elongated the token release period from 2 to 5 years (ending in July 2027). Simultaneously, adjustments to the V1 reward and penalty mechanism were made, including the extension of the attribution time frame from 28 to 90 days and modifying the early withdrawal reward structure to a linear 10%-75%.</p><p>Additionally, for unclaimed expired rewards, users will be removed from the incentive pool but have the option to initiate re-locking through the interface. The protocol’s fees have also been restructured, with Dynamic Liquidity Providers (dLP) emerging as the leading beneficiaries.</p><p>These comprehensive changes in the V2 version represent a more thoughtful and balanced approach, aligning more closely with both short-term and long-term strategic objectives, as compared to the initial V1 design.</p><h3 id="OFT-Omnichain-Fungible-Tokens"><a href="#OFT-Omnichain-Fungible-Tokens" class="headerlink" title="OFT (Omnichain Fungible Tokens)"></a><strong>OFT (Omnichain Fungible Tokens)</strong></h3><p>OFT, or Omnichain Fungible Token, represents an innovative approach to seamless interconnectivity between different chains supported by LayerZero. Functioning as a common token standard across these chains, OFT can effortlessly be moved from one chain to another, without the need for additional costs typically associated with cross-chain transfers. During a transfer, OFT is destroyed on the originating chain and recreated on the destination chain, maintaining its integrity and value.</p><p>As of the current Radiant V2 version, OFT’s utility is specifically tailored to Radiant’s native token RDNT. This specialized implementation permits RDNT to be amalgamated and divided across LayerZero’s supported chains, thus realigning the liquidity of the asset. Consequently, RDNT enjoys an adaptable supply on each chain, allowing for the development of intricate financial strategies and frequent arbitrage opportunities, which further diversify the token’s applications.</p><h3 id="Roadmap"><a href="#Roadmap" class="headerlink" title="Roadmap"></a>Roadmap</h3><p>Radiant’s future development roadmap includes the complete integration of LayerZero within its upcoming V3 and V4 versions. This integration aims to facilitate an uninterrupted cross-chain experience, broadening support for additional EVM chains in cross-chain borrowing and lending. By merging with LayerZero, Radiant addresses a long-standing issue of fragmentation in the crypto space, empowering users with the ability to utilize a consistent token standard across numerous chains. This harmonization not only enriches the user experience but also sets the stage for frictionless collateralization and lending of native tokens across LayerZero-supported networks within Radiant’s ecosystem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.2bncadxv639c.webp"                      alt="image-20230804162340922"                ></p><h2 id="Radiant-Performance"><a href="#Radiant-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Radiant Performance"></a>Radiant Performance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.5h98nxnvlho0.webp"                      alt="image-20230807111057656"                ></p><p>The provided information can be observed in the image sourced from DefiLlama above. With minimal value locked in Radiant V1 following its migration, it is reasonable to consider Radiant V2’s performance as reflective of these numbers. Notably, the Total Value Locked (TVL) has exhibited substantial growth since the start of 2023, surging multiple times to reach 280 million USD TVL, and currently stabilizing at 248 million USD. However, the market capitalization has displayed a roller coaster pattern, peaking at 136 million USD, a nearly tenfold increase from the beginning of 2023, and currently resting at 86 million USD. The Market Cap to Total Value Locked Ratio (TVL Ratio) offers valuable insights into the correlation between a DeFi project’s valuation and its demand. In the case of Radiant, a relatively lower market cap contrasts with a higher TVL, resulting in a TVL ratio of approximately 0.35. This ratio potentially signifies an undervaluation of the token.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.4wrnaaqqhqi0.webp"                      alt="image-20230807145757229"                ></p><p>Based on insights from the Dune Analytics data portal, following its initial gradual adoption, Radiant protocol experienced a swift surge in user engagement during the Arbitrum frenzy. However, with the introduction of Radiant’s V2 version, the pace of user expansion notably decelerated, leading to a more stabilized count of both new and existing wallets.</p><p>Radiant has made significant strides in its market presence thus far. However, the data analysis provided above also underscores an interesting trend within Radiant. Specifically, under the circumstances of stable or rising RDNT prices combined with robust liquidity mining incentives, both deposits and borrowings within Radiant are poised for potential further growth. However, it’s worth noting that Radiant’s competitive edge could wane should the landscape of mining rewards become more challenging. Moreover, in terms of user engagement, Radiant appears to have encountered a plateau following the introduction of its V2 version.</p><p>Presently, Radiant’s strategic focus centers on broadening its reach across additional blockchain networks and diversifying its support for various collateral assets. By expanding its service scope and garnering enhanced user participation, Radiant aims to fuel its next phase of expansion. Looking ahead, the protocol’s ultimate success hinges on its ability to tangibly drive widespread adoption of cross-chain lending in practical applications. On July 23, 2023, RDNT capital tweeted: After the successful demonstration of Arbitrum to BNB CHAIN, RFP-19 indicates that the next step for Radiant DAO is Ethereum. With Ethereum holding 26 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and 70 billion in underutilized stablecoins, it presents a significant growth opportunity, which can lead to substantial growth in both TVL &amp; dLP for Radiant protocol. </p><h2 id="Tokenomics"><a href="#Tokenomics" class="headerlink" title="Tokenomics"></a>Tokenomics</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.3i8mf6d3yfi0.webp"                      alt="image-20230807153802565"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.4d0u2ekl4eq0.webp"                      alt="image-20230807153817838"                ></p><p>RDNT has a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

RDNT Liquidity mining emissions can be instantly claimed for the total amount on the condition that they are zapped into locked dLP tokens by pairing the claimed $RDNT with wstETH/BNB. Alternatively, emissions may be vested for three months. Vesting RDNT may be claimed early for an exit penalty to receive 10-75% of rewards, decaying linearly during the three-month vesting period. This penalty fee is then distributed 90% to the Radiant DAO reserve, and the remaining 10% is sent to the Radiant Starfleet Treasury.</p><p>Radiant Capital has a total token supply of 1 billion. In the V2 version, the token release period has been extended to 5 years (until July 2027), providing a longer duration for token incentives. $RDNT tokens serve similar purposes to governance tokens in other DeFi protocols, being utilized for community governance and liquidity incentives.</p><h2 id="Team"><a href="#Team" class="headerlink" title="Team"></a>Team</h2><p>Radiant mentioned in an April blog post that Radiant Capital has a 14-member team with prior experience at Morgan Stanley, Apple, and Google. While anonymous teams can present risks, they may cause trust issues, lack accountability, transparency, and face marketing challenges. Investors and users prefer transparent teams for greater credibility and trust.</p><h2 id="Funding"><a href="#Funding" class="headerlink" title="Funding"></a>Funding</h2><p>Radiant Capital, a full-chain lending protocol on Arbitrum, received 3.34 million $ARB tokens during the recent Arbitrum DAOs Airdrop. On July 20, Binance Ventures invested 10 million USD in Radiant Capital. The new funds will be used for technology and product development, which includes expanding collateral and deployment on the Ethereum mainnet.</p><h2 id="Competition-AAVE-V3"><a href="#Competition-AAVE-V3" class="headerlink" title="Competition: AAVE V3"></a>Competition: AAVE V3</h2><p>Compared with Aave, Radiant Capital emphasizes enabling users to access major assets on any main chain and enhances the DeFi ecosystem’s efficiency by integrating fragmented liquidity across different chains while also offering lending services. As an example, users can deposit assets like ETH and USDT on Arbitrum and borrow assets such as BNB on BSC, and ETH on Ethereum. The borrowing process allows users to access different chains or L2 without the need for cross-chain asset transfers. This seamless experience enables users to easily engage in borrowing activities across various platforms.</p><p>According to Defillama’s data, as of August 7th, approximately 57% of the total value locked (TVL) is on Ethereum L1, while the remaining TVL is distributed across various other chains. Borrowing activities on these different chains are conducted independently, resulting in fragmented liquidity. RDNT aims to address the issue of liquidity fragmentation between different chains/L2 solutions, thus creating a seamless cross-chain borrowing market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20231009/image.18j3xgz28vr4.webp"                      alt="image-20230807171506715"                ></p><p>In the introduction of Aave V3, a new feature called “Portal” is highlighted. This feature enables seamless asset movement between different networks within the Aave V3 ecosystem. The process is straightforward: users provide liquidity on one network, and they can transfer it to another network by burning A Token on Chain A (e.g., Ethereum) and minting them on Chain B (e.g., BSC). </p><p>To implement the Portal feature, third-party cross-chain bridge protocols are involved. These bridges need to be whitelisted through Aave governance voting. It means that “burn-mint” operations on different chains are handled by these “whitelisted bridges” rather than the Aave protocol itself, introducing an element of third-party security assumption. The Aave V3 proposal has successfully passed votes to include Hashflow/Wormhole and Stargate as “whitelisted bridges” for V3 Portals.</p><p>Aave, being the largest lending protocol in the cryptocurrency market, could establish itself as the most liquid lending platform by introducing multi-chain lending services. The implementation of the Portal feature is expected to enhance liquidity and capital utilization within the Aave ecosystem, potentially making it a formidable competitor to Radiant. However, Radiant holds the advantage of being a first mover in this space. Furthermore, as Layer 0 continues to develop in the oracle and relay domain, Radiant may gain a competitive edge in terms of asset cross-chain security assumptions.</p><h1 id="The-end"><a href="#The-end" class="headerlink" title="The end"></a>The end</h1><p>In conclusion, RDNT (Radiant Token) stands as a promising project in the ever-evolving world of decentralized finance. With its innovative V2 version and focus on dynamic liquidity provisioning, RDNT aims to bridge the gap between different chains, providing users with seamless access to major assets across various networks. By addressing liquidity fragmentation and fostering a holistic lending market, RDNT seeks to become a driving force in the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>Please note that the information provided in this post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Layer-2-war-is-on-fire-Developments-in-Layer-2-networks"><a href="#Layer-2-war-is-on-fire-Developments-in-Layer-2-networks" class="headerlink" title="Layer 2 war is on fire: Developments in Layer 2 networks"></a>Layer 2 war is on fire: Developments in Layer 2 networks</h1><p>With the impending Cancun upgrade, Layer2 networks have emerged as the most prominent theme in the latter half of 2023. From July onwards, Layer2 has consistently held a Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding 10 billion US dollars. In recent days, numerous public chains have declared a transition to Layer2, with some even obtaining significant financial backing.</p><p>On July 12th, Manta Network, a public chain operating on a ZK-based Layer1, revealed its new Layer2 network, Manta Pacific, purpose-built for zero-knowledge proof (ZK) applications, utilizing OP Stack. Just a week later, on July 19th, p0x labs, the developer behind Manta Network, successfully raised 25 million USD in a Series A funding round, achieving a valuation of $500 million, with Polychain Capital and Qiming Venture Partners serving as co-leaders. In the midst of these developments, on July 17th, cLabs put forth a proposal to transition Celo from a standalone EVM-compatible Layer1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer2 structure, also employing OP Stack technology.</p><p>Alongside the well-known shift from Layer 1 to Layer 2 networks, the existing Layer 2 networks have seen a flurry of activity and announcements. This includes major players in the Rollup series networks such as Arbitrum, zkSync, and StarkNet, all of which have unveiled open-source toolkit Stacks for the construction of Layer3 networks. In addition, the Optimistic Rollup fork project MetisDAO Foundation has introduced its newly-incubated Hybrid Rollup series project ZKM, while Loopring Protocol has announced plans to build its own Layer3 layer using the zkEVM Layer2 network Taiko.</p><p>This series of developments underscore the fact that the Layer2 market has reached an intense and competitive phase. As shown by data from the crypto analytics platform Rootdata, there are now 77 recognized Layer2-related network infrastructures encompassing various elements like modular blockchains, zkRollup, Optimistic Rollup, and application chains. At present, the Layer2 market is primarily being led by two popular scaling solutions: Optimistic Rollup and zkRollup.</p><p>So, what are the representative networks of the Optimistic Rollup series and zkRollup series? Let’s dive into the development of them and find the potential opportunities.</p><h2 id="Optimistic-Rollup-Arbitrum-Optimism-Metis-Boba-Mantle"><a href="#Optimistic-Rollup-Arbitrum-Optimism-Metis-Boba-Mantle" class="headerlink" title="Optimistic Rollup: Arbitrum, Optimism, Metis, Boba, Mantle"></a>Optimistic Rollup: Arbitrum, Optimism, Metis, Boba, Mantle</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Name</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Token name</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Token price</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Market Cap</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>TVL</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Financing Amount</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Arbitrum</td><td align="center">$ARB</td><td align="center">$1.17</td><td align="center">$1.49b</td><td align="center">$5.96b</td><td align="center">$143.7m</td></tr><tr><td>Optimism</td><td align="center">$OP</td><td align="center">$1.65</td><td align="center">$1.18b</td><td align="center">$3.04b</td><td align="center">$178.5m</td></tr><tr><td>Metis</td><td align="center">$METIS</td><td align="center">$15.45</td><td align="center">$68.8m</td><td align="center">$82.31m</td><td align="center">$4m</td></tr><tr><td>Boba</td><td align="center">$BOBA</td><td align="center">$0.14</td><td align="center">$24.2m</td><td align="center">$10.43m</td><td align="center">$9.69 m</td></tr><tr><td>Mantle</td><td align="center">$MNT/BIT</td><td align="center">$0.52</td><td align="center">$1.69b</td><td align="center">$72.56m</td><td align="center">$200m from BitDAO</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(The data is from L2BEAT: <a class="link"   href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" >https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>)</p><h3 id="Arbitrum"><a href="#Arbitrum" class="headerlink" title="Arbitrum"></a>Arbitrum</h3><p>As of the 1st of August, the Arbitrum chain boasts a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately 5.96 billion USD, a figure that places it at the forefront of Layer2 projects globally. The chain’s native token, ARB, which was officially launched for trading in March 2023, is presently valued at 1.16 USD. With a circulating supply of 1.28 billion ARB and a total issuance of 10 billion, the market capitalization stands at an impressive 1.49 billion USD, earning a rank of 37th within the crypto asset market. Moreover, the Arbitrum chain leads the Layer2 landscape in various other aspects, including the quantity of deployed ecological applications and overall levels of vitality and activity.</p><p>As indicated by the Arbitrum Portal, the official gateway to the Arbitrum ecosystem, there are currently 567 included projects that span various sectors. These encompass applications ranging from wallets and cross-chain bridges to decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending mechanisms, games, and NFT platforms. Among these are widely recognized migrated applications such as Uniswap, Aave, Curve, and 1inch. Alongside these, the Arbitrum ecosystem is also home to innovative native solutions including GMX, a decentralized perpetual contracts system; Radiant Capital, a full-chain lending platform with the support from Layer Zero; Camelot, a native decentralized exchange; and Treasure DAO, a  metaverse gaming ecosystem.</p><p>Arbitrum, launched in August 2021, stands as a Layer2 scaling solution founded on Optimistic Rollup. Within the Arbitrum ecosystem, there are three distinct networks, each serving specific purposes: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, and Arbitrum Orbit.</p><ul><li><strong>Arbitrum One</strong>: Acting as the nucleus of the Arbitrum ecosystem, Arbitrum One is the core Rollup chain with all its transactional data housed on Ethereum’s mainnet. Often referred to as L2, this network facilitates on-chain ecosystem applications. Notably, Arbitrum One underwent an upgrade called Arbitrum Nitro, but retained its original name post-upgrade.</li><li><strong>Arbitrum Nova</strong>: Specifically tailored for gaming, social applications, and high-throughput DApp scenarios, Arbitrum Nova leverages AnyTrust technology. Unlike Arbitrum One, which ensures security through Ethereum, Arbitrum Nova offers lower security but compensates with 90% reduced gas fees. It is particularly apt for applications demanding high-frequency trading and minimal transaction fees, such as gaming and social platforms. Real-world applications include the Reddit community point system (like MOON), and the NFT markets launched by Opensea and TreasureDAO on Arbitrum Nova.</li><li><strong>Arbitrum Orbit</strong>: Serving as a development platform, Arbitrum Orbit is an open-source toolkit for constructing L3 networks. Developers can craft their Rollup and AnyTrust chains (L3) using the Orbit toolkit, electing either Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova as the settlement layer to achieve scalability. This selection process embodies a strategic balance between decentralization and performance. Several applications have already joined forces with Arbitrum Orbit to establish their own L3 networks. The Ethereum scaling service platform, AltLayer, has incorporated support for Arbitrum Orbit, enabling users to initiate Arbitrum’s L3 application chains in mere minutes through no-code tools. Furthermore, the Xai network, specifically designed for the gaming industry, announced in June its plans to utilize Arbitrum Orbit technology to launch an L3 blockchain meticulously crafted to cater to the gaming sector.</li></ul><p>Together, these networks illustrate Arbitrum’s multifaceted approach to blockchain scalability and functionality, catering to diverse needs and applications within the crypto space.</p><h3 id="Optimism"><a href="#Optimism" class="headerlink" title="Optimism"></a>Optimism</h3><p>Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Optimistic Rollup technology, and it is progressing towards becoming a super chain. Currently, the Optimism network has locked crypto assets valued at 3.04 billion USD, establishing itself as the second-largest Layer 2 network. Its native cryptocurrency, OP, has a market price of $1.61 and a total market capitalization of 1.18 billion USD, ranking 42nd in the crypto asset hierarchy. In comparison to Arbitrum, Optimism’s on-chain ecosystem appears slightly less flourishing. As per DeFiLlama’s statistics, Optimism’s ecosystem encompasses 153 identified applications. Despite this, Optimism has carved a distinct pathway in the Layer landscape by utilizing its OP Stack components, steering towards a realm referred to as the super chain.</p><p>OP Stack, developed by Optimism, is a comprehensive open-source toolkit that includes various components such as data availability, execution, settlement, and governance layers. This toolkit enables developers to craft a tailored Layer 2 network that suits their particular requirements.</p><p>This innovation led to the introduction of the “super chain” concept within Optimism’s ecosystem. A super chain consists of a collection of standardized Layer 2 blockchains, known as OP chains, constructed on top of OP Stack. Super chains represent a departure from traditional multi-chain architectures, such as those seen in Cosmos. Unlike multi-chain systems, where each chain introduces its own unique consensus algorithm, requiring new validators for each additional chain, super chains maintain standardization across all chains. The consensus algorithms are consistent, and security is upheld by a Layer 1 blockchain (e.g., the Ethereum mainnet). Additionally, this standardization facilitates the sharing of resources and information between chains.</p><p>By embracing the super chain structure, Optimism has effectively streamlined the interaction between chains, ensuring uniformity in consensus and security, while allowing for a more seamless integration of information and resources across the network. This creates a more robust and interconnected environment, distinguishing Optimism’s approach from conventional multi-chain solutions.</p><p>On June 24th, the Optimism blockchain underwent a rebranding, changing its name to OP Mainnet. This change serves to differentiate OP Mainnet from the multiple Layer 2 networks that form part of the broader Optimism ecosystem and are constructed using the OP Stack toolkit. In essence, OP Mainnet is a foundational chain within the larger structure of the Layer 2 super chain network. The renaming underscores the relationship between OP Mainnet and various other Layer 2 networks, all collaboratively comprising the Optimism super chain ecosystem. It highlights the interconnected nature of these networks and aligns with the strategic emphasis on standardization and integration within the ecosystem.</p><p>The OP Stack toolkit by Optimism has fueled various initiatives and collaborations across the blockchain ecosystem. Several projects are leveraging this technology to develop Layer 2 networks, catering to different applications ranging from identity systems to gaming. Here are some notable examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Base</strong>: Coinbase announced the launch of a Layer 2 network, “Base,” built on OP Stack. The mainnet is currently open to developers for deployment, with public access expected in early August.</li><li><strong>opBNB</strong>: BNB Chain initiated the Layer 2 testnet “opBNB,” based on OP Stack, with the mainnet anticipated to launch in Q3 2023.</li><li><strong>Magi</strong>: In April, a16z unveiled a Rollup client solution called “Magi,” created using the OP Stack toolkit.</li><li><strong>Worldcoin ID</strong>: Worldcoin ID announced plans to build an application chain using OP Stack, focusing on the development of an on-chain identity system ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Zora Network</strong>: NFT marketplace Zora revealed plans to introduce a Layer 2 network, “Zora Network,” built on OP Stack.</li><li><strong>Loot Chain</strong>: The Adventure Gold DAO of the Loot ecosystem is employing OP Stack to build a Layer 2 network, “Loot Chain,” utilizing its native token AGLD as a Gas Token.</li><li><strong>OPCraft</strong>: On-chain game developer Lattice is utilizing OP Stack to create a dedicated blockchain for its virtual world game, “OPCraft.”</li><li><strong>Celo</strong>: The development organization for Layer 1 public blockchain Celo, known as cLabs, has proposed a transition to convert Celo into a Layer 2 based on the OP Stack framework.</li></ol><p>Additionally, several gaming and NFT projects are opting to build their networks using the OP Stack framework, signifying the toolkit’s versatility and appeal to different sectors within the blockchain industry.</p><p>In addition to other improvements, Optimism has been diligently focused on enhancing its network’s performance. In June of this year, the company announced the completion of the Bedrock upgrade on its mainnet, leading to significant improvements in various areas. These enhancements included the reduction of transaction fees, decreased deposit confirmation times, and a notable boost in overall performance.</p><p>Data from Dune Analytics illustrates the substantial impact of the Bedrock upgrade, with average Gas fees per transaction on the Optimism network falling by roughly 75%. This has positioned the Optimism mainnet as one of the most cost-efficient Ethereum Layer 2 networks for token exchanges, boasting an average transaction Gas fee of just $0.1. The changes underscore Optimism’s unceasing dedication to offering an optimized, user-centric experience.</p><h3 id="Metis-Network"><a href="#Metis-Network" class="headerlink" title="Metis Network"></a>Metis Network</h3><p>Metis Network, also known as Metis, originated as a Layer 2 scaling network constructed upon Optimistic Rollup technology. This foundation enabled Metis to significantly diminish the latency in transferring assets from Layer 2 back to Layer 1, reducing withdrawal times to mere hours or even minutes. Given these adjustments, Metis has been recognized as a variant of Optimistic Rollup, with its main network named Andromeda.</p><p>On July 13th, the MetisDAO Foundation formally unveiled its newly incubated initiative, ZKM (previously known as Project M), announcing a transition from its existing Optimistic Rollup to a more advanced Hybrid Rollup system. The testnet for ZKM is scheduled for release before the year’s end.</p><p>ZKM employs a Hybrid Rollup (Mixed Rollup) mechanism, a novel Layer 2 scaling solution that synergistically combines the distinct features of both Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollup into a unified Rollup protocol. By integrating the coding simplicity provided by the ORU architecture with the finality, security, and decentralization that ZKRU can offer, this hybrid approach enables prompt withdrawals while safeguarding overall security. This fusion of the best attributes of two existing solutions into a singular Rollup framework highlights Metis’s innovative approach, signaling a promising stride toward more efficient and trustworthy scaling solutions.</p><p>The Metis Network, which ranks as the ninth largest among various Layer 2 networks, has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of roughly 82.31 million USD. Andromeda, the network’s main chain, uses the METIS token for on-chain Gas fee payments, with an average cost of 0.0064 USD per transaction. The current market price of the METIS token stands at 15.45 USD, resulting in a market capitalization of 68.8 million USD. According to DeFiLlama data, there are 31 applications on the Metis chain, including mainstream DeFi applications such as Aave, SushiSwap, and Stargate.</p><h3 id="Boba-Network"><a href="#Boba-Network" class="headerlink" title="Boba Network"></a>Boba Network</h3><p>Boba Network, founded by Enya, a core contributor to the OMG Foundation, is an Ethereum Layer 2 expansion solution utilizing Optimistic Rollup technology. In April of the previous year, the network successfully raised 45 million USD in a Series A funding round at a valuation of 1.5 billion USD. More than 400 participants contributed to this round, including notable cryptocurrency exchanges like Crypto.com, Huobi, and BitMart.</p><p>Distinct from other Layer 2 solutions, Boba Network presents a unique multi-chain Layer 2 extension methodology. It’s designed to enhance not only Ethereum but also any EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchains, transforming them into Layer 2 networks. Boba L2 has been implemented on various platforms, including Moonbeam, Fantom, Avalanche, and BNBchain.</p><p>At present, Boba Network’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) stands at a modest $10.43 million. The network supports 20 applications, featuring well-known platforms like SushiSwap, OolongSwap, and the lending service Bodh Finance.</p><h3 id="Mantle-network"><a href="#Mantle-network" class="headerlink" title="Mantle network"></a>Mantle network</h3><p>The Mantle Network, an Optimistic Rollup-based Layer 2 scaling solution, was developed with support from BitDAO and introduced its testnet in January of this year. Being an initiative of the centralized exchange ByBit, Mantle Network is recognized as a Layer 2 network endorsed by ByBit.</p><p>Mantle Network unveiled its Alpha version of the mainnet at the EthCC conference in Paris on July 17th. Unlike similar platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism, Mantle Network employs a modular architecture. This unique approach allows the separation of core blockchain functions like execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability onto specialized layers, enhancing network efficiency. By merging Optimistic Rollup with data availability methods, Mantle inherits Ethereum’s robust security while providing more cost-effective and easily accessible data.</p><p>In the mainnet configuration of Mantle, the execution layer is managed internally, with consensus and settlement handled by L1 Ethereum. A dedicated service provider called Eigenlayer takes responsibility for data availability, which includes both data storage and release. This setup fosters better on-chain integrity and introduces fresh opportunities for scalability.</p><p>In June, BitDAO announced the consolidation of BitDAO, Mantle, and the BIT ecosystem into a single entity known as Mantle. The MNT token was introduced as the unified currency for this ecosystem and will be used for transaction fees. Mantle Network has secured a $200 million investment from BitDAO, and BIT tokens are now interchangeable with MNT at a 1:1 ratio.</p><p>Currently, the Mantle Network hosts 89 DApp applications, ranging across areas like DeFi, infrastructure, and gaming. </p><h2 id="ZK-Rollup-ZkSync-Starknet-Polygon-zkEVM-Linea"><a href="#ZK-Rollup-ZkSync-Starknet-Polygon-zkEVM-Linea" class="headerlink" title="ZK Rollup: ZkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, Linea"></a>ZK Rollup: ZkSync, Starknet, Polygon zkEVM, Linea</h2><table><thead><tr><th align="center"><strong>Name</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Token name</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Token price</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Market Cap</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>TVL</strong></th><th align="center"><strong>Financing Amount</strong></th><th>ZK-EVM Types</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">ZkSync</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">$436m</td><td align="center">$458m</td><td>Type-4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Starknet</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">$108m</td><td align="center">$239m</td><td>Type-4</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Polygon zkEVM</td><td align="center">$POL</td><td align="center">$0.68</td><td align="center">$6.35b</td><td align="center">$54.56m</td><td align="center">$450m</td><td>Type-3</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Linea</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">/</td><td align="center">$29.05m</td><td align="center">$725 m</td><td>Type-3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(The data is from L2BEAT: <a class="link"   href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" >https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>)</p><p>Currently, zkRollup-based networks are primarily focused on compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). According to Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin, in his blog post titled “The different types of ZK-EVMs,” this compatibility can be categorized into four types: fully Ethereum-equivalent(Type-1), fully EVM-equivalent(Type-2), almost EVM-equivalent(Type-3), and high-level-language equivalent(Type-4). As shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/picx-images-hosting@master/20230912/Untitled.2o5f4oywh1w0.webp"                      alt="image-20230803152016930"                ></p><p>Polygon and Linea are classified under Type-3, being almost EVM-equivalent. They’ve made certain compromises in equivalence, reducing the time required for proof generation and simplifying EVM development, all with the goal of reaching fully EVM-equivalent, categorized as Type-2. On the other hand, zkSync Era and StarkNet are placed in Type-4, using their unique high-level programming languages. While this approach provides quicker verification times, it comes at the cost of reduced compatibility.</p><p>In this context, compatibility pertains to the ability of developers to replicate the experience of working on Ethereum, encompassing factors like the ease or complexity of application deployment. The time taken for proof verification indicates the duration needed for a user’s funds to transfer from L2 to L1. If this process takes several hours, users will be unable to move their funds back to L1 during that time.</p><h3 id="ZkSync"><a href="#ZkSync" class="headerlink" title="ZkSync"></a><strong>ZkSync</strong></h3><p>ZkSync, developed by the MatterLabs team, is a prominent zkRollup scaling solution employing zkSNARK technology (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge). In an announcement made in February of the previous year, the network’s versioning was clarified, with zkSync 2.0 renamed as zkSync Era and zkSync 1.0 as zkSync Lite. zkSync Era constitutes a ZK Rollup initiative rooted in zkEVM, ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), while zkSync Lite, incompatible with the EVM, primarily targets the payment sector.</p><p>As of the current reporting period, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the zkSync Era chain stands at $436 million. This positions it as the third-ranking entity among an extensive array of Layer2 networks, thereby solidifying its status as a flagship project within the zkRollup landscape.</p><p>In an industry development last June, zkSync unveiled ZK Stack, a sophisticated collection of modular open-source components devised for the construction of tailored zkRollup networks. With this toolkit, developers are endowed with the capacity to engineer bespoke zkRollup Layer2 and Layer3 structures, also known as HyperChains.</p><p>Additionally, zkSync Era disclosed on July 17 an imminent upgrade to the proof system known as Boojum. This evolution signifies a transition from the existing zkSNARK framework to a zkSTARK-supported proofing mechanism, underscoring the continuous innovation and growth within the zkSync ecosystem.</p><h3 id="Starknet"><a href="#Starknet" class="headerlink" title="Starknet"></a>Starknet</h3><p>StarkNet, engineered by StarkWare, operates as a zkRollup network extension, employing zkSTARK technology to scale its operations. Within StarkWare’s augmentation strategy, there are two principal components: StarkNet, serving as a Layer2 scaling network with a user-centric approach, and StarkEx, exclusively aimed at providing scalability solutions for existing Ethereum applications, including but not limited to dYdX, DeversiFi, and Immutable X.</p><p>As of the present analysis, StarkNet’s prominence is notable, with an on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) amounting to $108 million, positioning it as the second preeminent zkRollup network. A critical detail, however, is StarkNet’s non-compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). To surmount this challenge, StarkNet has devised a two-pronged approach: the integration of two projects within its ecosystem, namely kakarot and Warp. The former, kakarot, represents a zkEVM executed on StarkNet using the Cairo programming language and classifies under Type-2.5. Following a successful pre-seed financing round in June of this year, involving stakeholders such as StarkWare and Vitalik Buterin, a testnet launch for kakarot is anticipated imminently. Conversely, Warp functions as a transpiler, translating Solidity code into Cairo, aligning it with Ethereum’s EVM specifications, and is designated as Type-4. This bifurcated approach ensures compatibility across both high-level language constructs (through Warp) and at the EVM stratum (via kakarot).</p><p>During the Paris EthCC conference on July 19, StarkWare’s co-founder, Eli Ben-Sasson, unveiled plans for the imminent launch of StarkNet application chains (Appchains), underscoring StarkNet’s capabilities to enable the initiation of bespoke application chains. Further amplifying StarkNet’s innovative trajectory, the crypto liquidity platform Paradigm announced on July 21 the incubation of Paradex, a decentralized perpetual derivatives Layer2 application chain, on StarkNet.</p><h3 id="Polygon-zkEVM"><a href="#Polygon-zkEVM" class="headerlink" title="Polygon zkEVM"></a>Polygon zkEVM</h3><p>Polygon zkEVM represents an advanced scaling solution for the Ethereum network, leveraging Layer 2 zkEVM architecture and built upon ZK Rollup technology. The testnet was officially deployed on March 27th.</p><p>In June, Polygon disclosed the imminent introduction of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. This strategic enhancement will see Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm evolve into zkEVM Validium, aligning it with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology protocols. Polygon 2.0, driven by ZK technology, will incorporate a diversified multi-chain Layer 2 network ecosystem, encompassing elements such as zkEVM, PoS, and Supernets subnets. Notably, earlier collaborations with Immutable X and zkMeta underscored Polygon’s commitment to this technological direction, with initiatives targeting specific applications such as gaming.</p><p>July marked a significant milestone with the announcement of the conversion of the original MATIC token into POL, accompanied by the publication of a detailed whitepaper for the newly minted POL token. Designed to function across the entire Polygon network, the POL token will have an initial supply of 10 billion and will feature a 2% annual inflation rate. The token is also slated to be adopted as the GAS fee payment instrument within the Polygon PoS chain, providing a versatile asset for ecosystem participants.</p><p>Further enhancing its governance framework, the Polygon team revealed plans for Polygon 2.0 on July 13th. This refined model will be underpinned by “three major governance pillars.” Key components include an expansion of the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, the establishment of an ecological committee to oversee system smart contract upgrades and a well-structured community treasury governance system to allocate funding to prospective ecosystem initiatives.</p><p>As of the present, Polygon zkEVM’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) amounts to $54.56 million. The network hosts 19 deployed decentralized applications (DApps), including 9 dedicated to data infrastructure and cross-chain bridging. Other notable applications feature financial products such as the stablecoin QiDao, decentralized exchanges Quickswap and Leetswap, lending protocol 0vix, and the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading platform Zionic. This rich array of offerings positions Polygon zkEVM as a robust and innovative solution within the blockchain technology landscape.</p><h3 id="Linea"><a href="#Linea" class="headerlink" title="Linea"></a>Linea</h3><p>Linea, a Zk-rollup-based Layer 2 expansion solution that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), was developed by ConsenSys, the renowned parent company of MetaMask.</p><p>During the EthCC conference held on July 18th, ConsenSys made a significant announcement, revealing the official public release of the Linea zkEVM mainnet alpha version. To mark this event, participants involved in the Linea Voyage initiative were awarded specific NFTs as part of an airdrop.</p><p>The ecosystem surrounding Linea is robust and diverse, as indicated by Rootdata statistics. The network accommodates 71 projects, featuring deployed solutions such as the LineaBank lending application, the FWDEX decentralized exchange platform, XY Finance (a cross-chain exchange aggregator), Owlto Finance (a cross-Rollup chain), and the Zoni NFT marketplace. Additionally, it hosts mainstream DeFi applications, including but not limited to Aave, Airswap, Sushiswap, and Pancakeswap, some of which are actively being migrated and deployed. The total value locked (TVL) within the Linea chain has reached an impressive $29.05 million.</p><p>Addressing inquiries about the possibility of a native token within the Linea network, officials clarified the present strategy. Rather than introducing a separate digital asset, the Linea network leverages Ethereum, bridged directly from the Ethereum mainnet, serving as its ecosystem’s native currency. This approach underlines Linea’s alignment with the broader Ethereum network and its commitment to compatibility.</p><h1 id="The-end"><a href="#The-end" class="headerlink" title="The end"></a>The end</h1><p>The ongoing Layer 2 war is a vivid illustration of the relentless innovation and competition in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape. As different Layer 2 solutions vie for supremacy, each boasting unique attributes, compatibility with existing systems, scalability, and various functionalities, the stakes are high. The race to deliver the most efficient, secure, and user-friendly platform is reflective of the broader push to enhance the blockchain’s usability, thereby driving wider adoption.</p><p>However, investors must tread cautiously in this rapidly changing environment. The volatility that characterizes the market, particularly within the Layer 2 space, is not to be underestimated. With new technologies being deployed, updates being made, and strategic alignments being formed almost daily, the landscape can shift dramatically in a short period. Investors are urged to diligently research, understand the underlying technologies, evaluate the potential risks, and align their investments with their risk tolerance and long-term goals.</p>]]></content>

Assessing the market size and growth potential of the project is also essential. Reading the whitepaper can provide insights into the project’s objectives, use cases, and technology. The track record of team members reveals their ability to build and scale the product. Finally, the roadmap can be used to judge whether the project is proceeding as planned. It can serve as a supplement to other research, determining the likelihood of the project reaching its milestone goals.</p><h2 id="Popular-metrics-of-DeFi-Protocols"><a href="#Popular-metrics-of-DeFi-Protocols" class="headerlink" title="Popular metrics of DeFi Protocols"></a>Popular metrics of DeFi Protocols</h2><p>There are several popular indicators that can provide valuable references to understand the performance and potential of a DeFi project. These include the token’s Total Value Locked (TVL), 24-hour trading volume, inflation rate, price, and market cap.</p><h3 id="Total-Value-Locked-TVL"><a href="#Total-Value-Locked-TVL" class="headerlink" title="Total Value Locked (TVL)"></a>Total Value Locked (TVL)</h3><p>Total Value Locked (TVL) is the total amount of funds locked in a DeFi protocol. You can view TVL as the total amount deposited by liquidity providers into a protocol. For example, as of July 2023, Uniswap’s TVL exceeds 3.8 billion USD, meaning users have deposited more than $3.8 billion into Uniswap. You can review TVL to assess the overall interest in a specific DeFi protocol or use it to compare which DeFi protocols have “locked” more value. Attracting substantial TVL is often a sign of a strong project.</p><h3 id="Market-Cap"><a href="#Market-Cap" class="headerlink" title="Market Cap"></a>Market Cap</h3><p>The market cap reflects the total value of circulating tokens in a DeFi protocol. It is calculated by multiplying the current price of the token by the number of tokens in circulation. The market cap provides an overall assessment of the protocol’s size and prominence. However, it must be considered in conjunction with other factors such as the utility of the protocol and competition.</p><h3 id="24-hour-Trading-Volume"><a href="#24-hour-Trading-Volume" class="headerlink" title="24-hour Trading Volume"></a>24-hour Trading Volume</h3><p>The 24-hour trading volume measures the total value of transactions executed in a specific DeFi protocol over a 24-hour span. A high 24-hour trading volume indicates that the project is more active and has better liquidity, reflecting an active ecosystem and increased market interest. Conversely, a low 24-hour trading volume shows less buying and selling of the protocol’s tokens, and lower liquidity. Low 24-hour trading volume may signify a lack of interest or participation from traders and investors.</p><h3 id="Inflation-Rate"><a href="#Inflation-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Inflation Rate"></a>Inflation Rate</h3><p>Another important indicator is the inflation rate, referring to the rate at which new tokens are generated within the DeFi protocol. A lower inflation rate might be favorable, as it indicates a more controllable token supply, possibly increasing in value over time, such as ETH transitioning to a deflationary state after moving to POS, and BTC halving, where the new BTC output will be halved. However, assessing the overall token economy and allocation model to ensure a balance between incentivizing participants and maintaining token scarcity is crucial. This topic will be further explored in this article.</p><h3 id="Market-Cap-to-Total-Value-Locked-Ratio-TVL-Ratio"><a href="#Market-Cap-to-Total-Value-Locked-Ratio-TVL-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Market Cap to Total Value Locked Ratio (TVL Ratio)"></a>Market Cap to Total Value Locked Ratio (TVL Ratio)</h3><p>The Market Cap to TVL ratio provides investors with information about the relationship between a DeFi project’s valuation and demand. For example, if a protocol’s token market cap is low but its TVL is high, it may mean that the token is undervalued. If a token’s TVL ratio is below 1, it may be more attractive, suitable for potential investors.</p><h3 id="Number-of-Addresses"><a href="#Number-of-Addresses" class="headerlink" title="Number of Addresses"></a>Number of Addresses</h3><p>The number of wallet addresses is an indicator that measures the number of DeFi protocol participants. Similar to the user numbers of traditional Web2 applications, it is used to gauge user engagement. An increase in address numbers may be a good sign of growing popularity and adoption. It should be noted that this metric might be manipulated, as in the case of airdrops where an investor might have multiple addresses. Investors should use this metric in conjunction with other indicators.</p><h2 id="Tokenomics"><a href="#Tokenomics" class="headerlink" title="Tokenomics"></a>Tokenomics</h2><p>Tokenomics is a term that originates from the fusion of “token” and “economics.” It is a key concept in the cryptocurrency domain, referring to the economic principles and incentive systems for managing the creation, distribution, and value of tokens within a specific blockchain system.</p><p>Here are some aspects that tokenomics considers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Token Supply and Issuance</strong>: This involves the total number of existing or to-be-issued tokens. Some tokens have a fixed supply, while others may have a mechanism to mint new tokens. Issuance mechanisms can significantly influence the price and overall economy of the tokens. Fixed supply may lead to scarcity and possibly increase the price but might limit the system’s flexibility. Mintable tokens offer greater flexibility but could lead to inflation if mismanaged. For example, MATIC originally had a fixed supply cap of 10 billion, while the POL white paper allows for a specific rate of annual increase beyond the initial supply of 10 billion (all converted from MATIC).</p></li><li><p><strong>Token Distribution</strong>: How tokens are distributed among users can greatly impact the health and sustainability of the token economy. Fair and reasonable distribution helps maintain a healthy and active user base. Additionally, tokens may be distributed according to a vesting schedule, meaning they can be used within specific periods. This can encourage long-term holding and contribute to the token’s stability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Token Utility</strong>: Tokens usually serve specific functions within their ecosystem. They can provide services, voting rights, or other benefits to users. The utility of a token is a key factor in determining its value. Tokens that provide services, voting rights, or other benefits are more likely to retain value than those without clear use cases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mining and Staking Incentives</strong>: Many blockchain projects reward users for contributing to network security and stability with newly minted tokens, a practice known as mining or staking. Participation in incentive measures like staking rewards can encourage user engagement. However, this must be balanced to avoid vicious inflation or other unintended consequences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Token Burning</strong>: Some projects may choose to periodically “burn” tokens, permanently removing them from circulation to reduce supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Governance</strong>: Many tokens also serve as governance tokens, granting holders voting rights over the project’s future decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Policies</strong>: Tokenomics involves implementing economic policies at the protocol level, influencing how tokens are issued, distributed, and managed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: The security of tokens and their underlying blockchain technology is crucial. This includes the security of smart contracts managing the tokens and the overall security of the blockchain.</p></li></ul><p>Tokenomics is vital as it shapes the dynamics of digital assets and projects. By understanding tokenomics, investors can make more informed decisions about buying and holding particular tokens. It can also help project developers design more sustainable and successful token economies. Equally important, remember that the above-mentioned aspects are just things to consider; the “best” token economy may vary depending on the specific goals of the project. For instance, tokens aimed at incentivizing participation in decentralized applications may have different requirements compared to tokens intended to act as stablecoins.</p><h2 id="Assessing-DeFi-Technology"><a href="#Assessing-DeFi-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Assessing DeFi Technology"></a>Assessing DeFi Technology</h2><p>The technology that underpins DeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects is a critical factor in determining their feasibility and effectiveness. One of the key aspects to consider is the blockchain platform on which the project is built. For example, Ethereum is a popular choice, providing a robust and mature infrastructure for DeFi applications. Meanwhile, with the development of Layer 2 solutions, more and more projects are seeking collaboration with OP and ARB. Other Layer 1 blockchain have also emerged, offering promising options for scalable DeFi applications. Investors seeking to acquire DeFi tokens should weigh the pros and cons of the underlying blockchain to make an informed decision.</p><p>Another crucial aspect is the assessment of the smart contracts that drive the DeFi projects. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts on the blockchain, with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Although audits may not necessarily guarantee security, it is vital for DeFi projects to regularly audit their smart contracts to reduce potential vulnerabilities and protect user funds. Reviewing the smart contract audit history of a project can give insights into the team’s efforts to protect users.</p><p>Interoperability is another key aspect of DeFi tokens, ensuring seamless communication and interaction between different platforms and protocols. It allows tokens to be easily transferred, traded, and used across multiple decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain networks. Investors should check the interoperability of DeFi tokens before deciding to invest.</p><h2 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h2><p>Given the frequent occurrence of security vulnerabilities in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) sector, assessing a project’s security measures is crucial. Regular audits by reputable third-party companies, which indicate that the project is actively identifying potential vulnerabilities to ensure the security of smart contracts, are a positive sign. Considering the history of DeFi projects being targeted by hackers and the subsequent panic that ensues, robust security measures are a necessity.</p><p>In addition to audits, incentives similar to bounty hunters exist, such as bug bounty programs, which serve as another indicator of the project’s serious commitment to security. In a bug bounty program, the organization sets specific standards, guidelines, and rewards for individuals who discover and responsibly disclose valid security vulnerabilities. When bug finders identify vulnerabilities, they can submit a detailed report to the organization, outlining the issue, its impact, and the steps to reproduce the flaw. The organization then verifies the reported vulnerability, and if valid, offers a bounty or predetermined monetary reward to the bug-finder. This proactive approach to security encourages a community of security researchers to help improve the overall safety and resilience of the DeFi project.</p><h2 id="Team"><a href="#Team" class="headerlink" title="Team"></a>Team</h2><p>The following are common points to consider in team assessment for stock investments, which may be enlightening for evaluating teams within DeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects:</p><ul><li><strong>Assessing the Skills, Experience, and Qualifications of Team Members:</strong> Look for signs of success in similar enterprises or industries. The collective ability of the team should align with the company’s mission and goals.</li><li><strong>Researching the Team’s Compensation Structure:</strong> This includes salary, bonuses, and stock options (or token allocation in the context of DeFi). Stock options can inflate compensation figures and affect shareholder value. High compensation that doesn’t align with the company’s performance might be a warning signal.</li><li><strong>Observing Insider Buying and Stock (or Token) Repurchases:</strong> If management is purchasing company stock (or tokens), it might indicate their confidence in the company’s future. Conversely, if management is selling stock (or tokens), it may signal potential problems.</li><li><strong>Paying Attention to How Management Communicates with Shareholders and the Public:</strong> Transparency, regular updates, and a clear vision for the company’s future are all signs of strong leadership. Questions can be asked through social media, community channels, and AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions).</li><li><strong>Company Policies and Mission Statements:</strong> These can provide deep insights into management’s values and strategic direction. Look for evidence of ethical practices and a focus on long-term profitability.</li><li><strong>Being Alert to Potential Red Flags:</strong> Such as past fraudulent activities or ongoing legal issues.</li></ul><p>In the context of DeFi projects, these traditional considerations take on new dimensions, given the decentralized and often pseudonymous nature of blockchain projects. Still, careful analysis of the team’s background, alignment with project goals, compensation structure, and communication strategy can provide valuable insights into the project’s credibility, alignment with stakeholders’ interests, and long-term viability.</p><h2 id="Community-and-Social-Media"><a href="#Community-and-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Community and Social Media"></a>Community and Social Media</h2><p>The strength of a project’s community and user adoption is a key indicator of its potential success. These metrics provide valuable insights into the project’s viability, future growth prospects, and overall market acceptance.</p><ul><li>**Emotions and Engagement: **Emotion is an essential factor in trading and also a reflection of the strength of a project’s community. Engaging with the project’s community is vital to deeply understanding their sentiment, active participation, and overall enthusiasm. This interaction allows you to assess the levels of support, engagement, and trust within the community.</li><li>**Social Media Platforms: **Platforms like Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and even WeChat provide abundant information about the project community. Investors should monitor discussions, comments, and activity levels on these platforms, looking for signs of positive sentiment, active discussions, and growing follower numbers.</li><li><strong>Positive Sentiment:</strong> Positive sentiment indicates community trust and enthusiasm for the project. It’s often reflected in the tone and content of discussions within social media channels.</li><li><strong>Community Activities:</strong> Participation in community forums, AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions), and active community channels often indicates a thriving community that is engaged and supportive of the project.</li><li><strong>Warning Signs:</strong> On the flip side, investors should be cautious about manipulated sentiment, paid influencers, or unnatural spikes in activity that could be signs of artificial hype or misleading marketing strategies.</li><li><strong>Importance of Community in DeFi:</strong> In the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), community plays an even more significant role. Decisions related to the development and direction of a project often involve community voting and active participation from the stakeholders. A strong community can foster innovation, support the project through challenges, and contribute to the decentralized ethos that underpins these projects.</li></ul><p>Evaluating the community and social media presence of a DeFi project is a multifaceted task. It requires a nuanced understanding of various platforms, the ability to discern genuine sentiment from manipulation, and an appreciation for the role of the community in driving project success. Combined with other assessment factors like technology, security, and team evaluation, community analysis offers a holistic view of a project’s potential and can guide wise investment decisions.</p><h2 id="VC-investment"><a href="#VC-investment" class="headerlink" title="VC investment"></a>VC investment</h2><p>Venture Capital (VC) investment in a crypto project can have substantial impacts, both positive and negative. Here’s an analysis of how VC investment may affect a crypto or decentralized finance (DeFi) project:</p><h3 id="Positive-Impacts"><a href="#Positive-Impacts" class="headerlink" title="Positive Impacts"></a>Positive Impacts</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Increased Capital</strong>: VC funding provides the necessary capital to scale the project, develop technology, hire talent, and execute the roadmap. It can accelerate growth and enable the project to reach milestones more quickly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network and Expertise</strong>: VCs often come with vast industry networks and strategic insights. These connections can help in forming partnerships, gaining market insights, and providing mentorship to the team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trust</strong>: Backing from renowned VCs can bring trust to the project. It signals trust and often attracts further institutional and retail interest.</p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing and Community Building</strong>: VC investment can facilitate more substantial marketing efforts and community engagement, which can result in better visibility and adoption.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Negative-Impacts"><a href="#Negative-Impacts" class="headerlink" title="Negative Impacts"></a>Negative Impacts</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Control and Decision-making</strong>: Depending on the terms, VC investment may come with conditions that affect control and decision-making within the project. VCs might seek seats on the board or have a say in major decisions, potentially leading to conflicts with the original vision of the founders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Token Distribution and Economics</strong>: If not managed carefully, the token distribution to VCs might affect the token economics, potentially leading to an oversupply or concentration of tokens with a few entities. This can impact price stability and community dynamics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exit Pressure</strong>: VC funds usually seek returns on their investment within a defined period. This can lead to pressures on the project to deliver financial results, sometimes at the expense of long-term innovation or community interests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potential Misalignment with Decentralization Ethos</strong>: In some cases, VC involvement might be seen as contrary to the decentralized ethos of crypto projects, especially if there’s significant control exerted by the VCs. This could lead to community backlash or a shift away from the project’s original decentralized mission.</p></li></ul><p>VC investment in a crypto project is a multifaceted aspect that carries both opportunities and challenges. While it provides much-needed capital and potential strategic advantages, it also introduces complexities related to control, token economics, and alignment with the project’s vision and values.</p><p>Projects considering VC investment must carefully assess and negotiate the terms to ensure alignment with their long-term goals, community interests, and decentralized principles if they pertain to the specific project. Transparency with the community and stakeholders about the nature and terms of the investment can also be vital in maintaining trust and alignment.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Analyzing DeFi projects is a critical process in making informed investment decisions in the rapidly expanding field of decentralized finance. While the factors outlined above are essential for making wise choices, what’s even more vital is that investments should never exceed what one can afford to lose. Investors should proceed with caution, not only fully understanding the technical foundation, security measures, team competence, community engagement, and social media impact of the project but also scrutinizing potential risks and market volatility. VC investment may bring new opportunities and challenges, and this too requires careful assessment. Ultimately, investing in DeFi or any crypto projects should be based on comprehensive research and understanding, coupled with clear investment strategies and risk management plans. While pursuing returns, maintaining caution and responsibility is of paramount importance.</p>]]></content>

Waterloo 2023 Hackathon决赛入围项目了解 ERC-6551"></a>从ETHGlobal Waterloo 2023 Hackathon决赛入围项目了解 ERC-6551</h1><p>在入围ETHGlobal Waterloo 2023黑客松决赛的11个项目中有4个和ERC-6551相关，提供了多功能性和实用性，使它们成为更强大的数字资产，为NFT市场带来了新的活力。以下是4个项目的简介。</p><ol><li><p>AquaNet: <a class="link"   href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/aquanet-dzz2c" >https://ethglobal.com/showcase/aquanet-dzz2c<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>AquaNet是一个应用程序，它利用非同质化代币绑定账户（ERC-6551）使NFT能够在一个基于NFT的、由AI驱动的社交媒体网络中创建并记录其活动。每个符合条件的NFT都可以在’myPuddle’网络上创建自己的账户，使NFT能够建立并发展出一个独特的AI身份，这主要是由其现有特性生成的。它们将自动向其账户发布消息，列出其兴趣，并分享关于自己的信息。</p><p>AquaNet的个人资料只能铸造到Tokenbound账户。一旦铸造了AquaNet的个人资料，后端会自动索引该事件并开始创建个人资料。OpenAI的GPT-3.5用于根据NFT的元数据生成用户名、简介和语气。基于个人资料的发布频率，会定期自动生成帖子，并使用个人资料的语气生成。</p></li><li><p>Fukuro: <a class="link"   href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fukuro-3cdwv" >https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fukuro-3cdwv<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>Fukuro是一个利用EIP-6551创建拍卖市场的项目。用户可以在Fukuro上列出和出价购买捆绑包。Fukuro这个名字的灵感来自于日本的福袋（Fukubukuro），也被称为“幸运袋”。它们是神秘的密封袋，以固定价格出售。EIP 6551使得ERC721能够控制自己的“钱包地址”并持有资产。每个Fukuro可以包含任何以太坊地址可以包含的东西，包括其他NFT、ERC20代币等等。这使得可以交易各种各样的资产，从艺术收藏、交易卡片套装，甚至是精选的投资组合。</p></li><li><p>Piggybank 6551 NFT: <a class="link"   href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/piggybank-6551-nft-e2ai5" >https://ethglobal.com/showcase/piggybank-6551-nft-e2ai5<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>Piggybank 6551是一个有趣的NFT储蓄账户。用户可以铸造Piggybank NFT，然后通过一个可支付的函数或者直接向NFT的6551账户地址发送ETH来给它们充值。随着每个Piggybank中ETH的积累，NFT元数据的颜色、文本标签和属性会立即更新。一旦ETH被锁定在NFT中，提取它的唯一方式就是销毁NFT。</p></li><li><p>Tokenbound Titans: <a class="link"   href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/tokenbound-titans-5w6oq" >https://ethglobal.com/showcase/tokenbound-titans-5w6oq<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>Tokenbound Titans是一个基于ERC-6551，结合了动态生成NFT的NPC游戏。玩家是以NFT形式存在的NPC的拥有者，每个NFT对应的NPC都拥有不同的能力和特性。游戏的玩法围绕这些NPC之间的战斗展开，玩家可以在数字竞技场中策略性地对彼此下注。计算战斗结果的算法是链下的，并可以使用ZK-proof进行验证。</p><p>在战斗中获胜会奖励玩家让他们的NPC升级，这会增强健康、攻击、速度和装甲等属性，也能够为他们的NFT解锁新的能力和组合。随着NFT的升级，它们变得更强大、更多样化。这种进步系统为游戏增加了深度和持久性，激励玩家制定策略、适应并不断提高他们的NFT以主导游戏景观。</p></li></ol><p>Blur的出现给NFT市场带来了短暂的欢愉，同时伴随着NFT早期玩家出货，蓝筹NFT的价格下跌和市场对Azuki Elements的不满，都在诉说NFT市场惨淡。此前，NFT的作用大致可分为：艺术品，PFP，Pass Card，抵押品等。此时，对于视NFT为艺术品的藏家来说，可能是个好时机，只是此类玩家占比依旧是极少数（本人是不相信绝大多数币，图是具有实际价值的），另一个可能是市场在探索NFT可能带来的新的故事。</p><h2 id="ERC-6551是什么？"><a href="#ERC-6551是什么？" class="headerlink" title="ERC-6551是什么？"></a>ERC-6551是什么？</h2><p>ERC-6551是一项以太坊改进提案，该提案定义了一个系统，该系统为每个ERC-721代币提供一个智能合约账户。这些被称为”代币绑定账户”的账户允许ERC-721代币拥有资产并与应用程序交互，而无需更改现有的ERC-721智能合约或基础设施。简而言之，就是将过去的NFT变成一个个钱包，钱包里可以存在NFT，以及其他代币（参考Fukuro项目）。<em><strong>这不仅仅是实现了增量，同时也给过去的NFT（存量）带来了新可能。</strong></em></p><p>ERC-721代币正在越来越多地成为链上身份的一种形式（PFP）。然而，与其他形式的链上身份不同，ERC-721代币不能作为代理或与其他链上资产关联（DID项目比如.eth和.bnb）。这个限制与许多现实世界中的非同质资产实例形成了对比。例如，角色扮演游戏中的角色随着他们所采取的行动积累资产和能力（参考Tokenbound Titans项目的愿景；可以通过钱包买卖多种代币），自动化投资组合由多种同质资产组成（比如一个银行账号中有多种理财，定存等；钱包中也有代币和NFT等），一张可以进入某个场所并记录过去互动历史的打孔通行证（现实生活中的行程码；钱包中多个币的交易记录）。</p><p>这个提案通过一个无需许可的注册表为每个ERC-721代币部署唯一的、确定性地址的智能合约账户，从而赋予每个ERC-721代币以太坊账户的全部功能，同时保持与之前部署的ERC-721代币合约的向后兼容性。每个代币绑定账户都由一个ERC-721代币拥有，允许代币与区块链交互，记录交易历史，并拥有链上资产。每个代币绑定账户的控制权被委托给ERC-721代币的所有者，允许所有者代表他们的代币发起链上行动。</p><p>代币绑定账户与几乎所有支持以太坊账户的现有基础设施都兼容，从链上协议到链下索引器。代币绑定账户可以拥有任何类型的链上资产，并可以扩展以支持未来创建的新资产类型。</p><h2 id="ERC-6551-是如何实现的？"><a href="#ERC-6551-是如何实现的？" class="headerlink" title="ERC-6551 是如何实现的？"></a>ERC-6551 是如何实现的？</h2><p>ERC-6551的实现主要依赖于两个主要组件：</p><ol><li>无需许可的注册表：用于部署代币绑定账户。</li><li>代币绑定账户实现的标准接口。</li></ol><p>注册表是项目希望使用代币绑定账户的单一入口点。它有两个功能：</p><ul><li>createAccount：给定实现地址为ERC-721代币部署一个代币绑定账户。</li><li>account：一个只读函数，给定实现地址计算ERC-721代币的代币绑定账户地址。</li></ul><p>注册表将每个代币绑定账户部署为具有附加的不可变常量数据的ERC-1167最小代理。每个代币绑定账户的部署字节码都有特定的结构。每个代币绑定账户代理将执行委托给实现IERC6551Account接口的合约。注册表合约是无需许可的，不可变的，并且没有所有者。所有的代币绑定账户都应通过注册表创建。所有代币绑定账户实现都必须实现ERC-165接口检测。所有代币绑定账户实现都必须实现ERC-1271签名验证。所有代币绑定账户实现都必须实现特定的接口。</p><h2 id="ERC-6551有哪些特性以及可能性"><a href="#ERC-6551有哪些特性以及可能性" class="headerlink" title="ERC-6551有哪些特性以及可能性"></a>ERC-6551有哪些特性以及可能性</h2><ul><li>NFT资产所有权：ERC-6551 使 NFT 能够直接拥有自己的钱包和托管资产。 这意味着 NFT 可以在其内部存储各种代币，包括 ETH，甚至可以持有其他 NFT。 这与当前 NFT 无法拥有或与其他链上资产关联的限制相比是一个重大飞跃。</li><li>简化交易交易：该标准带来了许多优势，例如简化交易角色和 NFT 集的交易、提高市场效率。 这可以使 NFT 交易过程更加高效且用户友好。还可以为 NFT 市场的潜在买家和卖家提供更多透明度和信息。（参考Fukuro交易整个集合）目前的 NFT，并不具备 “自主存储历史记录” 的能力，如果想要查看一张 NFT 的交易记录，只能前往第三方的交易所查看相关记录。 同样的，“签名的控制权、链接的所有权”等一些至关重要的功能也是 NFT 无法自主实现的，只能依赖去中心化钱包。在此附上第一个ERC-6551NFT项目。Sapienz：<a class="link"   href="https://opensea.io/collection/sapienz%E3%80%82" >https://opensea.io/collection/sapienz。<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li><li>与AI交互：ERC-6551也开启了NFT与AI交互的可能性。 这可以带来创新的应用程序和用例，例如带有自己钱包的人工智能化身。在AI中一直有一个方向即开发AI Agent（代理人），比如AI管家帮助梳理日程，让ChatGPT扮演顾问的角色也是一种AI Agent。 如果将来你的AI管家的外表是一只猴子NFT，它还拥有ETH，OP等代币，可以为你的晚餐点披萨呢？又或者帮你进行投资呢？</li><li>在游戏、元宇宙中的潜力：假设在Pokemon go（宝可梦GO！）游戏中，玩家扮演角色，角色拥有不同的宝可梦（NFT），宝可梦可以通过打怪升级增加技能点数，培养性格等等。在Tokenbound Titans游戏中，不同的NPC都拥有不同的能力和特性，升级后也可以有不同的组合。目前在养成类游戏，卡牌类游戏中有可预见的契合度。在元宇宙中，可以设想装备数字服装和物品，或许有一天会出现像普拉达的古驰。</li><li>DID: 可以应用于目前依靠NFT进行空投代币的场景；又或者将NFT 作为链上身份（参考AquaNet项目），具有在社交属性，下次见面：你好，这是我的Doodles。</li><li>向后兼容性：最值得注意的是，ERC-6551 可以兼容现有的 NFT，无需包装或合约升级。 这意味着它可以在不破坏现有 NFT 生态系统的情况下被采用。</li></ul><h2 id="ERC-6551目前的风险"><a href="#ERC-6551目前的风险" class="headerlink" title="ERC-6551目前的风险"></a>ERC-6551目前的风险</h2><ul><li>价值赋能：一项新的协议可能是一个进步，但市场需要的不是新的技术或协议，而是这个技术和协议所能解决什么样的问题，多大程度地解决什么样用户的什么问题。目前市场上大多数币和图都是不具备实际价值的，投机，交易需谨慎。</li><li>用户体验和理解：用户友好的体验和理解对于采用是必要的。 ERC-6551 带来的复杂性可能会让用户更难理解这些 NFT 并与之交互。 这可能对其广泛采用构成障碍。目前Crypto中的很多应用都需要考虑用户体验的问题，这也是所有产品服务发展中不可避免的问题。</li><li>平台兼容问题：一些 NFT 平台可能不兼容或缺乏与 ERC-6551 集成所需的技术，获得现有 NFT 项目和平台的支持可能是一个挑战 。

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Questions-to-ask-before-I-invest-in-crypto"><a href="#Questions-to-ask-before-I-invest-in-crypto" class="headerlink" title="Questions to ask before I invest in crypto"></a>Questions to ask before I invest in crypto</h1><ol><li><p>Funding. I always look at funding first. If a project has no runway in a bear market it’s dead in the water. It’s a challenge to dig up these answers sometimes but my first steps are always Google and ask the team directly on their Telegram or Discord.</p><ul><li>Do they have enough capital in their treasury for at least two years’ runway?</li><li>Is their treasury held in fiat, stable or their own token? Example, FTX and its token FTT.</li><li>Do they have access to their treasury or is it vested?</li><li>Do they earn fiat outside of crypto?</li><li>Will their revenue grow as the project scales?</li></ul></li><li><p>Team. The infomation of team members can be found in their websites, socials, twitter, and LinkedIn. And the telegram channel and discord can be a good place to ask more questions about the project and team members. Sometimes the team can make great difference on the project. The xen was very popular when it first introduced to the market and there was a gas war since the founder is the No.21 in Google. </p><ul><li>Does the team have relevant experience?</li><li>Is their team large enough for a project of their size?</li><li>Is the CEO still active and does he/she appear to care?</li><li>Are they actively hiring?</li></ul></li><li><p>The developers in the team. Check LinkedIn for previous dev experience and <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/Artemis__xyz" >@Artemis__xyz<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> to see how active they are on GitHub. If they aren’t on Artemis you can check GitHub directly. How recent a commit is is more important than overall commit frequency though! The other reason why this is important is one of the biggest challenges in the crypto world is the code, since crypto and web3 are building on the trust and the coding is the fundemental of the safety. Hackers Already Profit Billions Dollars From Code Vulnerabilities.</p><ul><li>Are the devs active? (check GitHub)</li><li>Do the devs have blockchain experience?</li></ul></li><li><p>Tokenomics - Basic info can be found in their whitepaper.</p><p>Some basic terminology. </p><p>• Supply: Tokens in circulation atm</p><p>• Total Supply: Total tokens that will exist </p><p>• Market Cap: Total value in $ of tokens in circulation </p><p>• Fully Diluted Value (FDV): Total value in $ of total supply</p><p>Understanding these terms helps you spot tokenomics issues. If a project has a large difference in supply vs total supply, that’s a red flag. The theory of supply and demand states that the more of something there is, the less its value.</p><p>Supply side: The increase in a token’s supply over time is called emissions and the speed of emissions is important. If the token hits max supply over the next three months the supply increase will be so fast that demand is unlikely to increase with it and the token will lose value. However, if the emissions are slow and max supply won’t be hit for ten years, then the supply increase won’t have a significant impact on price over the short term. </p><p>Emissions can come from staking rewards, airdrops, user rewards for using the dapp and of course token unlocks. Unlocks come from allocations given to early investors, the team, treasury and other pots. You can usually find allocations in the whitepaper.</p><p>Allocation distribution is very important. If, for example, 40% of the supply is allocated to early investors and the unlocks happen over a few months, that’s a problem. Early investors are usually motivated sellers since they’re often 5x-10x up. Wouldn’t you be?</p><p>Demand side: So we’ve thoroughly covered supply, let’s look at demand. Here are the most common forms of demand for tokens. </p><p>• Incentives for holding : Arguably the most important driver for demand. If holding the token benefits the holder by rewarding staking APY or yield farming the demand increases. As long as the APY earned is comparable or higher to competitors and it’s viewed as safe. </p><p>• Store of value: Another driver for demand is that the crypto is a store of value. It is hard to argue that many cryptos outside of <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/search?q=$BTC&src=cashtag_click" >$BTC<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> are a store of value but it is a driver for demand so it’s worth noting. Negative case: FTT</p><p>• Community: A strong community can drive demand. Meme coins are proof of this. Most of them have no utility, no staking APY and are certainly not a store of value but they hold value and even do a 1000x based almost entirely on having a strong community.</p><p>• Utility: Last but not least utility. If holding the token provides some sort of utility like a blockchain’s native token allowing you to make transactions on that chain it creates demand. </p><ul><li><p>Who Want’s It? </p><p>Another important question is who is holding and what are their motives. This is a hard question to answer and it requires researching wallets and getting involved in the community but it can give you valuable insights. For example, if big bag holders are smart money - like VCs - I would play it safe because their selling could impact price in a big way. They also usually have inside information so they will sell before you can react if they need to. Many people think VCs are always early investors so they’re vested. Not true, VCs sometimes buy on the open market like you so they might be big holders even if they aren’t listed as official backers. You can often find this out by looking at big-holder wallets. If holders are dumb money then you can be a little more relaxed as dumb money is usually driven by fear and greed so predicting their moves is easier. Again meme coins are an example of this. In general, the best strategy for both is to take partial profit regularly.</p></li></ul><p>Questions to ask:</p><ul><li>Are team and advisor wallets locked for at least 6 months?</li><li>Is liquidity locked for at least 2 years?</li><li>If the token is unreleased has it been actively traded OTC by presale investors?</li><li>If the token is released, is it fully distributed?</li><li>If not fully distributed is vesting structured to not cause massive dumps?</li><li>If not fully distributed what percentage of the Fully Diluted Value(FDV) has been hit and how long till 100%?</li><li>Is token distribution good? (i.e. team &lt; 20%, advisors &lt;5%)</li><li>Add token unlock dates to your calendar!</li></ul></li><li><p>Tokenomics - Value Accrual</p><p>This is how the token will gain value over time. It ties into demand but it’s best to split it off when researching tokenomics. Here are the main ones: </p><ul><li>Deflation: Deflation is decreasing the supply of a token and it’s commonly achieved by burning a percentage of transaction fees or periodically buying back and burning large amounts of tokens. Reducing supply usually increases demand so deflation is good!</li><li>Locking Mechanism: Locking is a way to force people to hold on to a token. This is usually incentivised by providing higher APY if you lock your tokens in for a few months. Locking is an extremely powerful value accrual mechanism because it guarantees holders. Also, locked tokens are technically not in circulation so this can lead to a supply shock. This is where the amount of tokens in circulation becomes so low that it cannot meet demand. Locking mechanisms are great, as long as investors are willing to lock their tokens!</li><li>Utility Expansion: This is when a token gains more utility over time. You usually find this information by looking at the project’s roadmap. If their roadmap shows that they will add utility over time it could correspond to an increase in value.</li><li>APY, APR and Yield: A final note on APY and yield. While this can certainly be a driver for value accrual high APY can also lead to quick supply increases which reduce demand. Quick Tip: APY is compounding your gains whilst APR does not. An example of a token with great value accrual is GMX. You get 19% APR for staking but it’s paid out in eGMX (escrowed GMX) which you need to vest for 1 year to fully unlock. The vesting means stakers can’t dump their earnings right away and create sell pressure.</li></ul><p>Questions to ask:</p><ul><li>Is there a burning mechanism?</li><li>Does staking provide a high yield?</li><li>If yield is high is there a mechanism for fighting inflation?</li><li>Is the locking of tokens incentivised?</li><li>If tokens aren’t locked are users encouraged to hold? Special function, like holding BNB can reduce middle fee when deposit and withdraw.</li><li>Is there an escrow mechanism to reduce inflation like GMX’s eGMX?</li><li>Do they pay out more than they make?</li></ul></li><li><p>Tokenomics - Investors. Check the web, whitepaper and google the VCs.</p><ul><li>Are there any holders with over 5% of the supply who aren’t on the team?</li><li>Are you able to identify non-team big holders and do they pose a risk?</li><li>Are VCs invested and how long are they vested? (remember VCs can market buy)</li></ul></li><li><p>Community. Community is arguably more important than tokenomics. The value of the token is highly built on the trust. Bitcoin will be worthless if people don’t believe it. A lot of projects rally based on community alone. The only way to know if the community is strong is to spend time in their Telegram or Discord and see how good their Twitter engagement is. Examples: Shit, Doge. </p><ul><li>Do they have a genuine and large social following?</li><li>Do they have good social media reach and engagement?</li><li>Does the marketing appear ethical?</li><li>Do they communicate with their community?</li><li>Do they have good and active mods on their TG/Discord?</li><li>Does their community appear strong and happy?</li></ul></li><li><p>Use Cases. Check their website and whitepaper for this. Use case is important for long-term growth. Bonus points if the use case is valid in a bear market.</p><ul><li>Is their tech new?</li><li>Does their tech address successfully solve problems?</li><li>What is the market size for this tech and will grow?</li><li>Is there a desire for this tech in the space?</li><li>Is the tech scalable if this project were to grow?</li><li>Will use cases still exist in an extended bear market?</li><li>Are the use cases viable long-term or will they be easily replaced?</li></ul></li><li><p>Roadmap</p><ul><li>Does their roadmap indicate they plan to keep building and improving?</li><li>Does the roadmap have realistic timeframes?</li><li>Add important milestones to your calendar.</li></ul></li><li><p>Users, customer segment. Do the team update info often? Is the team active in the community? Are there positive vibes on Discord? Are haters shouted down by holders?</p><ul><li>Does the team care about users?</li><li>Are users loyal to the project?</li></ul></li><li><p>Competitors Analysis</p><ul><li>Do they have a lot of competitors?</li><li>Do they have an edge over competitors? Unique selling points.</li><li>What risks do their competitors pose?</li><li>Do they have a stronger community than their competitors?</li><li>Maeket share.</li><li>Entry Barries.</li><li>Competitors’ response.</li></ul></li><li><p>Risks. A lot of these can be answered while you are doing competitor research or answering questions in other categories. Whitepapers, websites, Telegram/Discord and general knowledge of the sector are all useful for answering these questions.</p><ul><li>Are there weaknesses that may prove critical?</li><li>Are the team focused on building or making money?</li><li>What are their biggest weaknesses and cant they realistically be overcome?</li><li>Will an extended bear market affect the project?</li><li>Is there a risk that regulation will kill the project? Chinese government killed the stepn project. </li></ul></li><li><p>Current Value. The fundmental analysis and technical analysis are important here. All we need to think about is when will we trade.</p><ul><li>Given all of the above is their current value fair or are they undervalued?</li><li>If undervalued does the estimated return outweigh the potential loss?</li></ul></li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="A-beginner’s-journey-to-DeFi"><a href="#A-beginner’s-journey-to-DeFi" class="headerlink" title="A beginner’s journey to DeFi"></a>A beginner’s journey to DeFi</h1><p>Entering into the DeFi world can be exceting but also confusing. For now, in the bear market, it’s a good time to learn. If you jump in the sea of Dapps without the knowledge, it’s easy to make some unwise investment decisions. The best way to get involved is to learn the risks and find what’s suitable for you. Here are my basic learning in DeFi.</p><h2 id="The-history-of-Finance"><a href="#The-history-of-Finance" class="headerlink" title="The history of Finance"></a>The history of Finance</h2><p>The earliest form of market exchange was peer to peer, also known as barter. At that time, if you wanted to trade two goats for a cow, you needed to find someone who owned the cow and was willing to get two goats. Barter was highly inefficient because it’s difficult to get the match. To solve this problem, money was introduced as a medium of exchange unit of account, and store of value. Some of them can be stones or shells. Similarly, the checks that led the trend of cashless transactions three centuries ago is also a breakthrough for fintech in the paper money era. Over the last century, we have had countless other innovations, ATM machines, online banking and transactions, wire transfers, and more, that have continued to evolve the way finance works. Importantly, these innovations were built on the backbone of centralized finance. While there may been some tech advances, the structure of today’s banking system has not changed much in the past century. To solve the problems in the existing finance system, decentralized finance was introduced to the stage.</p><h2 id="Problems-in-centralized-financial-systems"><a href="#Problems-in-centralized-financial-systems" class="headerlink" title="Problems in centralized financial systems"></a>Problems in centralized financial systems</h2><p>For centuries, we have lived in a world of centralized finance. Central banks control the money supply. Financial transactions are mainly done through intermediaries or middle services providers. Lending is done through traditional banking institutions. However, DeFi introduces a way that peers interact with peers via a common ledger not controlled by any other cnetralized companies or organizations. And it can provide some potential for solving some problems associated with the centralized finance.</p><ol><li><strong>Centralized control.</strong>  Centralization can be common in many countries, espically in China. Most people will be the clients of one or two banks, which can control the rates and fees especially in some localized banks. And this phenomenon spreads to some tech gaints plays leading roles in the fintech field like the Wechat Pay of Tencent, Alipay of Alibaba. Centralized control brings some other problems. Take WeChat Pay as an example. WeChat dominates the instant messaging market in mainland China, and even some international students from other countries video or text their parents in China. And WeChat Pay is a built-in feature of WeChat, which means that if your WeChat account is frozen due to some weird policy, you will not be able to control your funds in WeChat, which could lead to the death of startups that transfer money on WeChat.</li><li><strong>Limited Access.</strong> Some 1.7 billion adults worldwide still don’t have access to a bank account, according to <a class="link"   href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2018/05/18/gains-in-financial-inclusion-gains-for-a-sustainable-world?cid=ECR_TT_worldbank_EN_EXT" >data released by the World Bank<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. In addition to this, even with the account, you cannot access certain services because you have to meet certain requirements. For example, a bank may not want to bother with the small loan that a new business requires. However, in a DeFi world, the network, wallet address and some crypto currency are the only things needed to interact with hundreds of DApps. </li><li><strong>Inefficient.</strong> An international students will suffer from the poor oversea services of international transfers, which may take serval days with a high intermediate fees. Time is wasted in the four days it takes to travel from one country to the other one. Other inefficiencies include costly (and slow) transfer of funds, direct and indirect brokerage fees, lack of security, and the inability to conduct microtransactions, many of which are not obvious to users.</li><li><strong>Opacity.</strong> The current financial system is not transparent. Banks may call you to introduce a loan after the down payment your new car. But you know little about the health of the bank. Something really bad happened in China this year, that <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Henan_banks_protests" >clients cannot withdraw their funds from the bank<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. According to reports, at least tens of billions of RMB funds were involved, and about <a class="link"   href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-25/china-protesters-demand-back-billions-invested-in-suspected-scam" >400,000 depositors were affected<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. Apart from that, it’s difficult for clients to know if the rate is competitive when applying for a loan.</li></ol><h2 id="What-is-DeFi"><a href="#What-is-DeFi" class="headerlink" title="What is DeFi?"></a>What is DeFi?</h2><p>Ethereum (ETH) is currently the second largest cryptocurrency. Vitalik Buterin introduced the idea in 2014, and Ethereum mined its first block in 2015. Ethereum is in some sense a logical extension of the applications of Bitcoin because it allows for <em><strong>smart contracts</strong></em> which are code that lives on a blockchain, can control assets and data, and define interactions between the assets, data, and network participants. Ethereum and other smart contract platforms specifically gave rise to the <em>decentralized application</em>, or DApp. The drive toward financial DApps became the DeFi movement, which seeks to build create an open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem with minimized friction and maximized value to users. DeFi is fundamentally a competitive marketplace of financial dApps that function as various financial “primitives” such as exchange, lend, and tokenize. They benefit from the network effects of combining and recombining DeFi products and attracting increasingly more market share from the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><h2 id="DeFi-primitives"><a href="#DeFi-primitives" class="headerlink" title="DeFi primitives"></a>DeFi primitives</h2><p>TBC… This part will be shown in the blockchain understanding posts, which will be updated in the blog in a month.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-potential-use-cases-in-DeFi"><a href="#What-are-the-potential-use-cases-in-DeFi" class="headerlink" title="What are the potential use cases in DeFi?"></a>What are the potential use cases in DeFi?</h2><p>TBC…perfect these uses.</p><ul><li>Lending and borrowing<ul><li>MakerDAO</li><li>Compound</li></ul></li><li>Decentralized Exchanges<ul><li>Uniswap</li></ul></li><li>Derivatives market</li><li>Tokenization </li></ul><h2 id="Chanllenges-in-DeFi"><a href="#Chanllenges-in-DeFi" class="headerlink" title="Chanllenges in DeFi"></a>Chanllenges in DeFi</h2><ul><li><strong>Poor performance.</strong> Blockchains are inherently slower than their centralized counterparts, affecting applications built on top of them. Compared with Visa, which can handle upward of 65,000 TPS, Ethereum is capable of handling less than 0.1 percent of the throughput.</li><li><strong>High risk of user error.</strong> It can be difficult for newcomers to jump into the DeFi world and if the misuse occurs, it cannot be changed. DeFi ensures immutable operation but transform the responsibilities from the middle services providers to the end-user. It’s kind of the two sides of a coin. </li><li><strong>Bad user experience.</strong> Why should we transfer from the existing system to a DeFi world if with bad experiences?How to attract more users? The answer is to improve ‘the easy to use’. What’s more, easy to understand. And the designs of most Dapps in mobile platforms are weak.</li><li><strong>Bubbles.</strong> There are hundreds of products launching every day in the past few years, but few of them survived. </li></ul><h2 id="What-are-the-risks-in-DeFi"><a href="#What-are-the-risks-in-DeFi" class="headerlink" title="What are the risks in DeFi"></a>What are the risks in DeFi</h2><p>While DeFi can eliminate counterparts risk, cutting out intermediators and allowing financial assets to be exchanged in a trustless way, all innovative tech will introduce new risks. </p><ul><li><p><strong>Smart contract risk.</strong> DeFi is built on code. Since the public blockchian are open system, after deployed, all people can view and interact with it on a blockchain. And software is uniquely vulnerable to hacks and developer malpractice. Smart contract risk can take the form of a logic error in the code or an economic exploit in which an attacker can withdraw funds from the platform beyond the intended functionality. Code error can be easy to understand, but the economic can be tricky. There would be no explicit failure in the logic of the code but rather an opportunity for an economically equipped adversary to influence market conditions to profit inappropriately at the contract’s expense, like the <a class="link"   href="https://content.11fs.com/article/what-the-bzx-flash-loan-exploit-says-about-the-future-of-defi" >flash attacks were executed in February 2020 on bZx Fulcrum<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Governance risk.</strong> There are some DeFi applications that are dependent on a human-governance process that actively adjusts protocol parameters to keep the system solvent. In which condition, users and investors must acquire a token that has been explicitly assigned rights on a liquid marketplace. Once acquired, holders use these tokens to vote on protocol changes and guide future direction. Governance tokens typically have a fixed supply, helping to resist any attempt by anyone to gain a majority (51%); however, they expose the protocol to the risk of being controlled by malicious actors. <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/trueseigniorage/status/1370956726489415683?lang=en" >A governance attack can be the True Seigniorage Dollar(TSD)<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oracle.</strong> Fundamentally, oracles aim to connect the off-chain and on-chain info. Many DeFi protocols require access to secure, tamper-resistant asset prices to ensure that routine actions such as liquidations and prediction market resolutions function correctly. Protocol reliance on these data feeds introduces oracle risk. If an oracle’s cost of corruption is ever less than an attacker’s potential profit from corruption, the oracle is extremely vulnerable to attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scaling.</strong> The proof of work consensus mechanisms used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum require a large amount of electricity for its computing power. To expect each miner to process all the financial transactions for a global financial market is unrealistic. And that can be the reason of high gas fee.  One solution can be the <em>proof of stake</em>, which replaces mining of blocks with staking an asset on the next block, with majority rules similar to proof of work. A user escrows funds in a smart contract and is subject to a penalty (slashed funds) if they deviate from expected behavior.  </p><p>TODO: Solana and Layer-2 can be introduced here. </p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory.</strong> As the DeFi market increases in size and influence, it will face greater regulatory scrutiny.  The legality of certain services and projects can be difficult to ascertain. If you are invested in a smart contract that is subsequently shut down due to regulatory problems, then your funds can be at risk. Currently, most blockchain projects are not allowed in China. But that won’t stop the enthusiasm of some Chinese tech advocates. A friend of mine is a user of a popular gamefi project called STEPN which came up with an idea “Run to Earn”. He told me that the floor price for an NFT can be 4 SOL. But STEPN has stopped serving in China since the Chinese regulation and lost more than 90% of its users, most of them Chinese, within a day. At that time, STEPN reportedly had more than 3 million daily active users.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="THE-LEAN-PRODUCT-PROCESS"><a href="#THE-LEAN-PRODUCT-PROCESS" class="headerlink" title="THE LEAN PRODUCT PROCESS"></a>THE LEAN PRODUCT PROCESS</h1><p><em>The Lean Product Playbook</em> written by Dan Olsen shows a detailed guide on how to find product markets and make products people love. Unlike some books that are long in theory and short in practice, this is the first book I’ve read that really explains how to apply Lean Startup concepts in a practical, step-by-step manner. I’m so glad to have the book when I have the passion to build something inspired. </p><p>And this note is more about listing some topics I really love in this book.</p><h1 id="Core-concepts"><a href="#Core-concepts" class="headerlink" title="Core concepts"></a>Core concepts</h1><p>The journey starts with why products failed and followed by the <em><strong>product-market fit</strong></em>, which captures the essence of what it means to build a great product. </p><blockquote><p>Product-market fit:</p><p>My definition of product-market fit…is that you have to build a product that creates significant customer value. This means that your product meets real customer needs and does so in a way that is better than the alternatives.</p></blockquote><p>I used to pay more attention to some ideas or concepts like advertisement, marketing, business models, and how to increase the customer lifetime value, and this definition tells me there is a distinction between <em>creating</em> and <em>capturing</em> values in the process. In order to capture values, you have to create it first.</p><p>The other core concept in this book is the <em><strong>Problem Space and Solution Space</strong></em>. </p><blockquote><p>Any product that you actually build exists in solution space, as do any product designs that you create—such as mockups, wireframes, or prototypes.</p><p>Problem space is where all the customer needs that you’d like your product to deliver live.</p></blockquote><p>And the customer needs can be expanded to some other concepts like job-to-be-done, customer desires, or customer pain points. I attained many courses who starts with idetifying the job-to-be-done, which emphasizes the importace of finding what not be done or well to solve customers real problems. And sometimes I find that some blogs or books often talk about the differences between the “what” versus the “how.” The “what” describes the benefits that the product should give the customer—what the product will accomplish for the user. The “how” is the way in which the product delivers the “what” to the customer. The “how” is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. “What” is problem space and “how” is solution space.</p><h1 id="The-Lean-product-process"><a href="#The-Lean-product-process" class="headerlink" title="The Lean product process"></a>The Lean product process</h1><p>The content of product management process can be divided into these steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Determine your target customers.</strong> This is the bottom of our pyramid since different customers will have different needs and even those who have the same needs may have different views on their relative importance. </p></li><li><p><strong>Identify underserved customer needs.</strong> Before we mover to design a solution, we have to validate the job-to-be-done, customer pain points or customer desires. Since customer needs can seem somewhat fuzzy when we interview them, and they are not skilled at describe the roots of the problem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Define your value proposition.</strong> At this point, we have identified several important customer needs, now we need to decide which ones our product or service will address. </p></li><li><p><strong>Specify your MVP feature set.</strong> Now we have a clear understanding of our value proposition, we have decided on the feature set for our MVP, identifying functionality required to validating we are heading on the right direction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create your MVP prototype.</strong> At this stage, we want to create a user experience or prototype that we can show to customers so that we can test our ideas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test your MVP with customers.</strong> In this part, we conduct both qualitative and quotative user test to see how it compares to the target value. </p></li><li><p><strong>Then Iterate to improve product-market fit.</strong> I learned a loop called ‘build-measure-learn’, which means we want to use what we have learned after we receive a round of feedbacks to modify our hypotheses and MVP so that we can test them with customers again. We want to iterate quickly with the goal of improving product-market fit.</p></li></ul><p>Some tasks will be performed in these steps:</p><ul><li><p>Understanding and representing user needs.</p></li><li><p>Defining a vision for a product.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring the market and developing competitive analyses.</p></li><li><p>Aligning stakeholders around the vision for the product.</p></li><li><p>Prioritizing product features and capabilities.</p></li><li><p>Creating a shared brain across larger teams to empower independent decision-making.</p></li></ul><p>There are some benefits of Lean or agile management. First, because we are planning in smaller increments, we can react to changes in the market or new information more quickly. Second, our product can reach customers earlier, which means that we can start hearing feedbacks from customers on our actual products sooner, which helps guide our subsequent product management efforts. Third, teams can reduce their margin of error in estimating scope by working in smaller batch sizes.</p><p><em>TBC… Some concepts in Agile will be added, and some tools will be here in the future after I have the experience of the whole loop. Some other ideas can be the link and differences between design thinking and the lean product process. From a lifelong learning perspective, how to be a good problem-solver?</em></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="How-to-solve-problems-TBC"><a href="#How-to-solve-problems-TBC" class="headerlink" title="How to solve problems? (TBC)"></a>How to solve problems? (TBC)</h1><p>Nowadays, people are hired not only to realize functions, but more to solve problems. Besides that, in personal life, we are around by various problems. One day, if we are given a problem, how to solve it effectively? And how to be a good problem solver?</p><h1 id="1-Types-of-Problems"><a href="#1-Types-of-Problems" class="headerlink" title="1.  Types of Problems"></a>1.  Types of Problems</h1><p>Before rushing into how to solve problems, let’s start with the types of problems.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/image-hosting@master/images/Xnip2022-09-12_08-39-34.5kiie8k66og0.webp"                      alt="Types of problems"                ></p><p>This idea is coming form Problem-Solving: The Owner’s Manual by Pierce Howard, which can be combined with Bohn’s talking about the link between causes and effects in class. Figure 1 shows the types of problems with the general activities to solve them in blue rectangles. Problems can be divided into two parts: solutions are known and unknown. In the first part where solutions are known, the ideal type is the best solution to a problem is obvious based on complete knowledge, then we implement it. If the best solution is not obvious, where we have solutions with certain outcomes, then we should compare and decide one best solution. Sometimes, we have solutions with uncertain outcomes. What we must react is to decide which solution has the highest probability of success. One example here can be how to choose the best design of the garden for maximum residents’ satisfaction. If the potential solutions are in a jumbled list without priority, what we do can be determining the priority order based on the effects. But complete knowledge situation rarely happens. Most times problems come in a way we are not familiar with. If the cause is unknown, the first thing we should do is finding the cause. If the cause is known or irrelevant, we can generate ideas that could fix the problem. So, the messages to take can be different based on the types of problems, which depends on our state of knowledge. </p><h1 id="2-The-process-to-solve-problems"><a href="#2-The-process-to-solve-problems" class="headerlink" title="2.  The process to solve problems"></a>2.  The process to solve problems</h1><p>Problem solving is a process, consisting of 4 key stages, which can be divided to problem definition, solutions generation, evaluating and choosing best solution, and solution validation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/image-hosting@master/images/Xnip2022-09-12_08-39-50.3vx50pkfh960.webp"                      alt="stages to solve problems"                ></p><p>Figure 2: 4 stages to solve problems</p><p>To solve problem effectively and creatively, the first stage should be defining the problem we want to solve. Identify the stakeholders who have a say in the way we solve this problem and what they want. Then describe the vision which should include is the trouble trying to solve now. By asking whys to get the potential root causes we need to address. Then try to write down what we want to achieve in the future. Sometimes we can even get the key factors based on prior knowledge and experience. Some tools may help a lot here, like fishbone diagram to the causes. Some people tend to answer the first problem without checking if this is the right we really want to solve.</p><p>In the next stage, generating solutions. After discovering the real problem that we really want to solve, try to concentrate on generating many solutions such as a target 20 potential alternatives and should not evaluate them at all. Many times, an idea that would have been thrown away immediately, if evaluating properly, can develop into an excellent solution.</p><p>The third stage should be evaluating and choosing the best solution. In evaluating step, some constraints should be taken into consideration like cost, safety, policy, etc. Write the good points and bad points of every solution and state the unique point after looking through all the constraints and targets for all potential solutions. Sometimes, numbers and facts will help us decide the final solutions if the solution can show certain outcomes. For solutions with uncertain outcomes, decision to the best one may be made by feeling, which can be the result of our skills, experience, and knowledgement, place in the right limiting circumstance. Some tools like SWOT can help us to shortlist our potential choices. Besides that, we can also ask our team members for voting. If all the solutions cannot meet the needs, we may go back to the start of the cycle to check the problem statement and go the journey again.</p><p>The last stage should be validating the final solution. The beginning of this stage is deciding how we will make the solution happen. Testing will be made serval times and confirming that the solution has been carried out as planned. Ask our stakeholders’ feedbacks and evaluate the results. Then make the next plan to improve and integrate.</p><h1 id="3-How-to-be-a-creative-problem-solver"><a href="#3-How-to-be-a-creative-problem-solver" class="headerlink" title="3.  How to be a creative problem solver?"></a>3.  How to be a creative problem solver?</h1><p>After learning how to apply different models and tools to solve problems, maybe we can solve new problems we are not familiar, but can we always get a creative and effective solution? The answer is no. But we can always get useful solutions by developing our personality traits. </p><p>After the journey to understand what creativity is, I was totally attracted by these brilliant artists and innovators, leading me on a trip to discover what makes us creative, where ideas come from, and how they come to life.</p><p>Creativity is the ability to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour. (William Blake) The ability to perceive and produce novel ideas or products that are useful to society. Creativity is the art of problem solving.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/image-hosting@master/images/Xnip2022-09-12_08-40-07.196g0gdg8vxc.webp"                      alt="Creativity process and Problem solving"                ></p><p>Figure 3 shows the 4 stages of creativity and problem solving.</p><p>The process starts with preparation, which is all about gathering information. In this stage, we gather related information and materials by conducting users research and empathize with them in order to get the real pain points and define the problem. At this stage, we can use a variety of ideation methods to understand and build problems and ideas from various angles.</p><p>Stage 2 is incubation, where let mind wander. After collecting information in stage 1, take a step away from the ideas before working on them. Open your mind to all ideas unconsciously, and new connections come slowly.</p><p>Next comes the illumination, where shows Eureka. After a period of incubation, insights arise from the deeper layers of the mind, and the ideas show up suddenly. It’s the sudden Eureka moment! </p><p>The fourth stage is about verification and production. Following the Eureka moment, ideas enter your mind and it’s time to evaluate, test, develop, and verify them. At this stage, you will prototype and test your idea to see if it meets the user needs defined in the preparation stage, get feedbacks and learning, then polish it up.</p><p>From these 4 stages, the creativity process oscillates between convergent and divergent thinking. Incubation and illumination are about inspiration, whereas preparation and validation are about generation. To go forward, we should seek the balance between dreaming and doing. Personal traits will show how we will perform the choice. For example, doers will shine in the preparation and verification stages, and dreamers will be the stars in incubation and illumination stages. If you are a doer, sometimes you may find you can really get things done in a brilliant way but lack the new ideas since focusing on the productivity. For a long-term growth, you can read, travel, meet different people, and open your mind to different views. Clean out the space for dream and imagination. For dreamers, who may be stuck too much in their marvelous ideas, try to practice more and apply the skills into real world. </p><p>Quote to end, ‘Know thyself’. We are on a lifelong journey to learn and grow.</p>]]></content>

票，并且必须获得多数选民的支持，才能获得资格。</p><p><strong>最终提案：</strong>一旦满足以上的要求，创始人就会将提案升级，尽可能多地保留原始提案的原意。但如果涉及法律或财务考虑，就有机会增加细节并重组提案。最终提案随后由创始人发布，而具体取决于执行提案所需的 ETH 多少，决定出投票率会在 5-15%

ETH的ATH。</p></li><li><p>这个夸张的上涨在当时非常不可思意，直到今天仍然如此。不但在暴涨之前没有任何重大公告，事实上，在之前的一个多月里，discord 中根本没有任何公告。虽然在5 月 5 日，Doodles 宣布他们将发布一个重大公告，以及来年的 4

Dooplicator 是什么，我们都期待它具有创新性并再次突破界限。</li><li>不过，「Dooplication」也有机会存在过度饱和的风险，特别是如果 Dooplicated 项目与 Doodle NFT 的区别不够大，就会有很大问题，因为这样的话可能会对原始 Doodles 的价值产生负面影响。</li><li>不过又不过，团队肯定都会意识到这种问题的出现，我们希望「Dooplication」的设计对这一点有深思熟虑。</li></ul><h3 id="未来的-IRL-活动"><a href="#未来的-IRL-活动" class="headerlink" title="未来的 IRL 活动:"></a>未来的 IRL 活动:</h3><ul><li>SXSW

Keep in mind, these are different from the data life cycle, which describes the changes data goes through over its lifetime. Let’s walk through the steps to see how they can help you solve problems you might face on the job.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/AllenZhuer/image-hosting@master/images/ask.6ywbe172q540.webp"                      alt="ask"                ></p><h2 id="Step-1-Ask"><a href="#Step-1-Ask" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Ask"></a>Step 1: Ask</h2><p>It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:</p><ul><li>Define the problem you’re trying to solve </li><li>Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations</li><li>Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions</li><li>Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication</li><li>Take a step back and see the whole situation in context</li></ul><h3 id="Questions-to-ask-yourself-in-this-step"><a href="#Questions-to-ask-yourself-in-this-step" class="headerlink" title="Questions to ask yourself in this step:"></a>Questions to ask yourself in this step:</h3><ol><li>What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?</li><li>Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://git.poker/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/blob/master/images/prepare.txsx4n9t6cw.webp?raw=true"                      alt="prepare"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Prepare"><a href="#Step-2-Prepare" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Prepare"></a>Step 2: Prepare</h2><p>You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="What-is-my-favourite-application"><a href="#What-is-my-favourite-application" class="headerlink" title="What is my favourite application?"></a>What is my favourite application?</h1><p>Today, I realized I spent more than 10 hours on Coursera every week for the past year and I really enjoyed this platform. Coursera is a platform that you can build skills with online courses from top institutions and universities. I like it since I can learn a lot from top universities whenever and wherever I am, no time, places limits at a low cost or even free. I learnt a lot  courses on it and I really want to introduce it to you. </p><h1 id="How-did-I-know-Coursera"><a href="#How-did-I-know-Coursera" class="headerlink" title="How did I know Coursera?"></a>How did I know Coursera?</h1><p>I still remember the first time I met Coursera when I was learning Deep Learning taught by Andrew Ng, who was a famous professor in Stanford University. At the end of his class in deeplearning.ai, he would introduce us Coursera created by Daphne Koller and himself. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) was bringing educational and vocational courses online and Coursera totally won my fragemental time on PC. Similarly, Weixin Reading introduced online reading to the public in China, and became the most visited app on my phone when I was free. </p><h2 id="What-is-the-customer-journey-map"><a href="#What-is-the-customer-journey-map" class="headerlink" title="What is the customer journey map?"></a>What is the customer journey map?</h2><p>The general process of an individual user can be divided into the following steps.</p><ul><li>Log in as individual user or enterprise users</li><li>Find the courses you want by searching jobs, skills, or universities</li><li>Read the introduction of the course and enroll</li><li>Take the course with your customize schedule</li><li>Take all discussions, tests, peer value, and quiz</li><li>Earn a certificate provided by Coursera and institutions</li><li>Share your learning and certificates to LinkedIn or other platforms</li></ul><h1 id="Business-model-of-Coursera"><a href="#Business-model-of-Coursera" class="headerlink" title="Business model of Coursera"></a>Business model of Coursera</h1><h2 id="Who-are-the-customers-Customer-Segments"><a href="#Who-are-the-customers-Customer-Segments" class="headerlink" title="Who are the customers? (Customer Segments)"></a>Who are the customers? (Customer Segments)</h2><p>Coursera provides services to two main kinds customer segments. The first one is educational institutions like universitties and companies, which wants to share course resources with a fully access. The other one can be the end-users who want to learn some skills in specific fields but may find it difficult to get access to educational resources. </p><p>The following types of people can be their potential end-users:</p><ul><li>High school students who want to take college courses in advance.</li><li>College students who want to take online courses rather than offline courses.</li><li>College students who want to learn extracurricular skills.</li><li>Fresh graduate students who want to decide or change career path.</li><li>People who already have a job want to strengthen their existing knowledge.</li><li>People who already have jobs and want to learn new skills.</li></ul><p>Try to imagine this scenario: more and more people realize the importance of life-long learning. As a fresh graduate, Allen is pursuing  a full-time job related to product management, business development. For a better fit, he chooses courses related to digital product managemt, Data analysis, and project managemtn on Coursera and spends 10 hours per week on it. </p><h2 id="What-value-does-Coursera-deliver-to-customers-Value-Propositions"><a href="#What-value-does-Coursera-deliver-to-customers-Value-Propositions" class="headerlink" title="What value does Coursera deliver to customers? (Value Propositions)"></a>What value does Coursera deliver to customers? (Value Propositions)</h2><p>When it comes to what customer needs Coursera want to satisfy, it allows end-users like me easy and complete access to top educational online resources that  many constomers may find unaffordable or inaccessable through its website and application.</p><p>Sharing high-level courses also means that universities and insititutions can reach a greater number of consumers more easily, futhering their individual brand identities. </p><h2 id="How-does-Coursera-make-money-Revenue-Streams"><a href="#How-does-Coursera-make-money-Revenue-Streams" class="headerlink" title="How does Coursera make money? (Revenue Streams)"></a>How does Coursera make money? (Revenue Streams)</h2><p>Courserea starts its journey with the goal of providing high-level education resources for free to anyone looking for it. Now, Coursera charges from several channels to improve its services. </p><h3 id="Free-access"><a href="#Free-access" class="headerlink" title="Free access"></a>Free access</h3><p>There are many ways to get access to some courses for free since some courses are provided to everyone for free. Besides that,  people can choose audition when choose whether to pay for the course so that  they still have access to most course materials for this course without a certificate.</p><h3 id="Certificates"><a href="#Certificates" class="headerlink" title="Certificates"></a>Certificates</h3><p>Most courses are offered with no charge. However, people who want to earn a certificate of completion which is a trusted and shareable way to showcase their new skills can choose to pay the course fee. This feature was landed in 2013, giving paying students access to graded assignments, homework, and examinations. If completed satisfactorily, they can earn a verified certificate at the end of the course, and they can visit the course in the future with no limits. The course fee varies between from <strong>$39</strong> to <strong>$89</strong> depending on the course.

Compared to traditional certificates, Coursera provides this service with a lower fee of <strong>$400</strong> per employee per year. Enterprise packages comes with higher cost than personal or teams’ plan. Coursera for Campus provides silimar option to the government and universities.</p><p>Since higher price and growing customers in this segment, it has quickly become a key channel of revenue.</p><h3 id="University-Degrees"><a href="#University-Degrees" class="headerlink" title="University Degrees"></a>University Degrees</h3><p>Collaborated with top universities world wide, Coursera offers students a chance to complete a fully recognized Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree, including MBA from UIUC. The price is far lower compared to degrees in campus, but with the same instructors who teach in person. Scholarships are provided. It’s reported that Coursera generated <a href="(https://s27.q4cdn.com/928340662/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/COUR_Earnings-Infographic_Q1-FY21.pdf)">$12.0M</a> in revenue in Q1, 2021 with 13,493 students enrolled. </p><h1 id="Competitve-analysis"><a href="#Competitve-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Competitve analysis"></a>Competitve analysis</h1><h2 id="SWOT-Analysis"><a href="#SWOT-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="SWOT Analysis"></a>SWOT Analysis</h2><h3 id="Strength"><a href="#Strength" class="headerlink" title="Strength"></a>Strength</h3><ul><li>Strong relationships with its key partners to offer colourful and high-level courses.</li><li>First-move advantages: kind of becoming market standard. After Coursera, many universities or educational angency like MOOC China, and MIT opensource, built their own platform which follows these standards. What’s more, the earlier Coursera ran into the market, the bigger market share it would take. Some MOOC platforms like Xue Tang Zai Xian created by Chinese government and universities has limited market usually in domestic rather than a golbal market. </li><li>Good environment to spread courses. Multi-lanuage courses are provided to learners from all over the world. At the same time, Coursera advocates learners to take part in translation event so that subttitle will be translate into their mother language and would be offered after reviews.</li><li>Diverse revenue channels. Multiple revenue model enables Couresera great resources to not only keep competitve to the threat of newcomers but also invest into R&amp;D.</li></ul><h3 id="Weakness"><a href="#Weakness" class="headerlink" title="Weakness"></a>Weakness</h3><ul><li>Services Coursera provided are more focus on solution space, which means more about what can they do. Sometimes they ignore the interests of external stakeholders.</li><li>Poor visual design. Terrible design on both Andriod and iPhone.</li></ul><h3 id="Opportunities"><a href="#Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Opportunities"></a>Opportunities</h3><ul><li>Covid-19 has changed many people’s lifestyle. Some universities promoted hybrid teaching model, and sea of students were trying to get access to online learning. Even after Covid, people really enjoy online learning since they can follow their own schedule.</li><li>Globalization enables Coursera more international markets. Growth in international market can also help Coursera diversify the risk as it will be less dependent on domestic market for revenue.</li><li>Technology empowering more possibilities. With the development and application of Machine Learning and AI, more smart features including recommendation can be offered to keep customers active.</li></ul><h3 id="Threats"><a href="#Threats" class="headerlink" title="Threats"></a>Threats</h3><ul><li>Government Regulations. Coursera should keep a close eye on the fast changing government regulations under the growing conflicts environment .</li><li>Customers are moving toward mobile  which can hamper the growth as Coursera  still hasn’t got a comprehensive mobile strategy.</li></ul><h1 id="What-can-be-improved"><a href="#What-can-be-improved" class="headerlink" title="What can be improved?"></a>What can be improved?</h1><h2 id="Nice-improvements-from-my-experiences"><a href="#Nice-improvements-from-my-experiences" class="headerlink" title="Nice improvements from my experiences"></a>Nice improvements from my experiences</h2><p>As a customer, although Coursera provides great services,  for more effience and easy of use, some nice improvments can be the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A calendar that shows due dates for assignments and quizzes across all of your courses</strong>. When I signed up for 3-4 classes, it’s hard to keep track of what is due and when. Optional email reminders would be a nice touch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quick feedbacks and colorful interations to keep users active.</strong> Solving small but not so primitive tasks by students could help feeling the progress. And the more types of such quizzes are presented (not just a multiple choice), the more learners will be willing to join. What’s more, peer value and discussion can be offered for students to communicate more to help each other so that they will spend more time on it to get a better understanding and build the willing to learn other related courses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Better interaction design on Mobile application.</strong> A terrible journey starts when open Coursea on both Android and iPhone. It’s difficult for me to get what I want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Better recommendation performance.</strong> Sometimes, after finishing one course, if learners want a deep understanding of specific field, a good recommendation at the end of learning will keep them engaged.</p></li></ul><p>More testing should be conducted so that we can learn from the feedbacks from users and provide higher-perforance services.</p><h2 id="Future-plan"><a href="#Future-plan" class="headerlink" title="Future plan"></a>Future plan</h2><p>Some plans can be taken into consideration for further marketing.</p><ul><li>Conduct geographic analysis to move to new markets.</li><li>Conduct IP analysis to keep competition out of the door.</li><li> Invest more in building an easy-use mobile application.</li><li>Keep existing customers active so that improve their customers life value. Some nice try can be introducing a new product or service of Coursera to existing customers, improving interaction and visual design.</li><li>Improve customer loyalty of Coursera Coursera’s customers. Marketing efforts can be used to increase loyalty among existing customers by organizing events, and by providing post purchase information and services.</li><li>Increase brand awareness. Features like stronger and multiple sharing channels can reach new audiences on social media. What’s more, newcomers have a better chance of choosing a course through a friend’s recommendation.</li></ul><p>More info and market analysis should be conducted to build a good strategy. Will be added soon.</p><h1 id="Thank-you-for-your-time"><a href="#Thank-you-for-your-time" class="headerlink" title="Thank you for your time : )"></a>Thank you for your time : )</h1>]]></content>

href="#如何搭建博客" class="headerlink" title="如何搭建博客"></a>如何搭建博客</h1><ol><li><p>在你喜欢的地方建立一个名字为 ‘blog’ 的文件夹（名字也可按你喜欢的来）</p></li><li><p>进入blog文件夹：<code>cd blog</code></p></li><li><p>初始化：<code>hexo

接下来就在自己喜欢的编辑器里编写吧，我自己使用过Vscode、Typora、以及Obsidian等来写Markdown以及管理自己的笔记。个人推荐Typora：界面简洁，所见即所得。Typora最近开始收费喽，大家看看自己的荷包吧，Obsidian目前仍然免费，但是功能强大，适合建立自己的知识网络，用来写博客是在大材小用。</p><ol start="6"><li><p>在写完后，同样进入到blog文件夹下，运行</p><p>清理：<code>hexo clean</code></p><p>启动：<code>hexo g</code></p><p>生成：<code>hexo s</code></p><p><img                       lazyload

hexo-deployer-git --save</code></p></li><li><p>接着更改blog文件夹下面**_config.yml**的配置，如下</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

将博客部署到远端。中间会让输入github密码，输入即可，后续部署完成，即可访问你的远端地址。例子就是这样的: <a class="link"   href="https://allenzhuer.github.io/" >https://allenzhuer.github.io/<i class="fas

></p><p>这里呢，由于我使用了主题可能会和你的页面有一些差异，不过也没有问题，接下来我们将开始部署主题。</p><h1 id="选个喜欢的主题吧"><a href="#选个喜欢的主题吧" class="headerlink" title="选个喜欢的主题吧"></a>选个喜欢的主题吧</h1><ol><li>最重要的就是选主题了：<a class="link"   href="https://hexo.io/themes/%EF%BC%8C" >https://hexo.io/themes/，<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> 超多主题随你选择。</li></ol><p>我选择的主题为 <a class="link"   href="https://keep-docs.xpoet.cn/" >keep<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>，里面有非常详细的介绍，请移步吧。</p><ol start="2"><li>铛铛，部署完主题后，别忘了它们：</li></ol><p>清理：<code>hexo clean</code></p><p>启动：<code>hexo g</code></p><p>生成：<code>hexo s</code></p><p>部署：<code>hexo d</code></p><p>部署之后，可能有一点点延迟，等一小会儿就行了，捏一捏桌子上的小黄鸭吧。</p><p>如果在你的博客中发现图片加载较慢的问题，推荐一个图床平台 <a class="link"   href="https://picx.xpoet.cn/#/upload" >Picx<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> , 希望能够帮到你。</p><h1 id="域名"><a href="#域名" class="headerlink" title="域名"></a>域名</h1><p>最后一步是购买一个自己喜欢的域名，因为我思来想去的域名已经被别人购买了，并且也没有抱有此博客被许多人看到的想法，所以域名购买暂时告一段落。等到哪天域名过期或者是想到新的域名再来继续更新吧。</p><p>一些购买域名的网站推荐：<a class="link"   href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/jg117mu2-u1HQNLIIIIHJLKORNNO" >NameCheap<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a> , <a class="link"   href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/r975xdmjdl09641111021627938"

For example, the time I write this note is about one hour(active time), but I should spend time on learning, watching the vedio, building my knowledge, and thinking the way how to write it, etc.    </li></ul></li><li><p>Unrealistic effort estiamtion: Happens when you underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete the task. Often, the culprit for under estimating effort is optimism. And listen, optimism is a wonderful trait for a project manager to possess. But too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that could set your plans behind schedule. </p><ul><li><p>How to avoid unrealistic effort estimation?</p><p>Your teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task and should be able to provide you with the best estimate.</p><p>Asking the teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation since they’ll have a deeper understanding of the work and the nuances of what’s required to complete the task.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Buffer: Extra time added to the end of task or project to account for unexpected slowdown or delays in work progress.</p><ul><li><p>Task buffer: Extra time tacked on to a specific task.</p><p>Task buffers should be used primarily for tasks out of team’s control. For example, when my team needs to buy some materials, the time that good shipped from the vendor to my company may delay one or two days.Task buffers should be used more sparingly for tasks within the project team’s control.</p></li><li><p>Project buffer: Adding a buffer to every task could lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily, leaving you, your team, and your stakeholders with an unrealistic timeline. This is where project buffers come in handy. Project buffers differ from task buffers in that they provide extra time to the overall project schedule.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Run-fast-pay-later-A-case-study-on-time-estimation"><a href="#Run-fast-pay-later-A-case-study-on-time-estimation" class="headerlink" title="Run fast, pay later: A case study on time estimation"></a><strong>Run fast, pay later: A case study on time estimation</strong></h2><p>Kendra just scored a project manager role on a new project. It was a highly competitive bid, and the company and Kendra are eager to do a great job.</p><p>Kendra realized immediately that the timeline for the project would be almost impossible to execute. However, this was the first big project she was asked to manage. Therefore, instead of letting management know about the project’s impossible timeline, Kendra kept quiet and was determined to make it work. She rushed through the planning phase to get the team moving since time was ticking towards the project completion date. Kendra created all of the planning documents without input from her team or other stakeholders, with the sole intention of reaching the deadline.</p><p>During the team meeting, Kendra presented her project plan to the team. Right away, team members expressed their concerns with the timeline. They felt like there wasn’t enough time to complete their work, and they worried that the timeline didn’t incorporate enough time for reviews. Kendra documented the team’s concerns, but instructed them to simply work faster and make it happen.</p><p>As the project went on, the project faced schedule delays and other issues due to rework, previously unaccounted for tasks, stressed team members, and concerned stakeholders. Ultimately, the project missed its deadline. Later, the company did a retrospective to determine where things went wrong, and Kendra learned a lot of important lessons.</p><h3 id="Analysis-of-the-case"><a href="#Analysis-of-the-case" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of the case:"></a>Analysis of the case:</h3><h4 id="Escalating-concerns"><a href="#Escalating-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Escalating concerns"></a><strong>Escalating concerns</strong></h4><p>Kendra realized the timeline is problematic at the beginning. Instead of communicating with team members and stakeholders, and sharing the info, she decided to keep the issue to herself. She moved fast to meet the timeline instead of slowing down and planning the project throughly.</p><h4 id="Working-carefully"><a href="#Working-carefully" class="headerlink" title="Working carefully"></a><strong>Working carefully</strong></h4><p>If Kendra had taken the time to work carefully through the planning process, she may have been able to build a more realistic project plan to deliver the best product to the customer. She might also have identified potential time-saving activities that could have helped her team meet the project deadline. Thorough and careful planning with her team could have helped Kendra identify problems and solutions in advance, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Elimination of tasks</strong>. It is possible that all of the tasks initially listed didn’t need to be completed. There may have been unnecessary work added in, and the team could have completed the project without it.</li><li><strong>Increased team size</strong>. Kendra could have addressed the potential schedule risk by requesting more resources like team members and budget early on in the project rather than trying to execute without the necessary resources.</li><li><strong>Streamlining of activities</strong>. There may have been some tasks that could have been done in parallel, or at least not in sequential order.</li></ul><h4 id="Gathering-input-from-the-team"><a href="#Gathering-input-from-the-team" class="headerlink" title="Gathering input from the team"></a><strong>Gathering input from the team</strong></h4><p>Kendra should have brought together team members, peers, and management to help build and review her project plan, especially given the challenges of meeting the proposed project timeline. Kendra also didn’t take action to address the concerns of the team members who were responsible for completing the tasks within the estimated time. </p><h3 id="Scenario-Time-estimation"><a href="#Scenario-Time-estimation" class="headerlink" title="Scenario: Time estimation"></a>Scenario: Time estimation</h3><p>Consider the following scenario: You are to oversee the project for a new text book release for the fall semester. You’ve done something similar before, so you feel confident speaking with the stakeholders, project sponsor, and faculty director. You assure them the project will meet the 6-month deadline.</p><p>Around three months into the project, you notice that your writers consistently miss the writing deadlines you assign. Then you learn that a printer upgrade may delay printing the text books. Unfortunately, you forgot to include this delay in your time estimation. Now you have to tell the stakeholders that the project may not launch in time for fall. </p><p>What might you do differently next time to improve the outcome of this situation?</p><ul><li>Before the project launch, we should talk with the writer to get an accurate time to finish the task.</li><li>The printer upgrade is a task out of project team’s control, so task buffer should be taken into consideration. Additionally, when the project manager first learns about the printer issue, we should immediately update the time estimation and inform stakeholders.</li><li>The project manager can also look towards potential time saving activities, including: eliminate tasks, increase the team size to get more work done and meet the deadline, and streamline any of the activities in order to complete them in parallel with other tasks.</li><li>All-in-all, it’s important to perform time estimation, effort estimation, and add buffers to build realistic plans for reaching the project goal and ultimately, success!</li></ul><h2 id="Capacity-planning-and-the-critical-path"><a href="#Capacity-planning-and-the-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="Capacity planning and the critical path"></a>Capacity planning and the critical path</h2><h3 id="What-is-capacity-planning-and-critical-path"><a href="#What-is-capacity-planning-and-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="What is capacity planning and critical path"></a>What is capacity planning and critical path</h3><p>Capacity: the amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of time. In short, A man can only do so much, so when assign work, try to take capacity into consideration.</p><p>Capacity planning: Capacity planning refers to the act of allocating people, and resources to project tasks. And determining whether or not you have the necessary resources required to complete the work on time.</p><p>Here is a delivery example, one company sets their goal to ship 1000 bags to 8 areas in 4 days, and one courier can finish one area even if he spends all-day on his work, so two courier are needed for this mission. The capacity planning is to ensure enough people and resources to the task. It’s important to have a clear tasks and milestone, and then here comes the critical path.</p><p>Critical path: the list of project milestones that you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule. As well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. Your critical path includes the bare minimum number of tasks and milestones you need to reach your project goal. </p><p>Then what we should do is to go back to WBS and set estimates on how long it will take to finish these tasks, from when to when. </p><h3 id="What-may-affect-critical-path"><a href="#What-may-affect-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="What may affect critical path?"></a>What may affect critical path?</h3><ul><li><p>Identify which tasks can happen in parallel VS. which tasks can happen in sequentially.</p><p>Follow the delivery project. They have to hire two couriers before they ship these bags, so find tasks happened in sequentially can give priority to these tasks. At the same time, the company can push other tasks like mock up the design and test to develop a new website.</p></li><li><p>Determine which tasks have a fixed start date.</p><p>A fixed start date refers to the date on which you must start work on your task in order to achieve your goal. If you plan to start the ship on Tuesday, then maybe get all bags ready on Monday.</p></li><li><p>Determine which tasks have an early start date.</p></li><li><p>Identify if the task has a <em>float</em>. (also called slack) Float refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule, and threatens the project outcome. This helps identify what is not on your critical path. For instance, tasks on the critical path should have zero float, meaning there is no room for delays.  If you plan delivery on a specific date, then zero float for  this task.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Why-the-critical-path-is-critical"><a href="#Why-the-critical-path-is-critical" class="headerlink" title="Why the critical path is critical?"></a>Why the critical path is critical?</h3><p>The critical path helps you determine <em><strong>the essential tasks</strong></em> that need to be completed on your project to meet your end goal and <em><strong>how long each task will take</strong></em>. The critical path also provides a quick reference for critical tasks by revealing which tasks will impact your project completion date negatively if their scheduled finish dates are late or missed. A critical path can help you define the resources you need, your project baselines, and any flexibility you have in the schedule.</p><h3 id="How-to-create-a-critical-path"><a href="#How-to-create-a-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="How to create a critical path?"></a>How to create a critical path?</h3><p>Step 1: <strong>Capture all tasks</strong>.  Make a list of all tasks related to the project, you can refer to previous documents like <strong>WBS</strong>.

These techniques are useful if you are asked to identify the <strong>earliest and latest start dates</strong> (the earliest and latest dates on which you can begin working on a task) or the <strong>slack</strong> (the amount of time that task can be delayed past its earliest start date without delaying the project).</p><ul><li>The <strong>forward pass</strong> refers to when you start at the beginning of your project task list and add up the duration of the tasks on the critical path to the end of your project. When using this approach, start with the first task you have identified that needs to be completed before anything else can start. </li><li>The <strong>backward pass</strong> is the opposite—start with the final task or milestone and move backwards through your schedule to determine the shortest path to completion. When there is a hard deadline, working backwards can help you determine which tasks are actually critical. You may be able to cut some tasks—or complete them later—in order to meet your deadline. </li></ul><p>Further reading:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.workamajig.com/blog/critical-path-method" >How to Use the Critical Path Method for Complete Beginners<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.wrike.com/blog/critical-path-is-easy-as-123/" >Critical Path Method: A Project Management Essential<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team"><a href="#Getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team" class="headerlink" title="Getting accurate time estimates from your team"></a>Getting accurate time estimates from your team</h2><p>When you try to estimate the time for tasks, it is the stage to get all your team members in, by a two-way discussion, and you’ll need to tap into your soft skills to get the most accurate estimate from your team.</p><p>Soft skills: personal characteristics that help people work effectively with others.</p><p>Soft skills for accurate estimation:</p><ul><li><p>Asking the right questions</p><p>Ask open-ended questions. Take Office Green project as an example. You’ve discussed the design of the new website with your web designer, and you’d like to know how long it will take them to mock up designs for your review. </p><p>Can you complete the mock-ups in one week? (Close-ended question with answer yes or no) May ask the following questions to learn more about how they work and what they do.</p><ul><li><p>How long does it typically take you to mock up a website design like this one? </p></li><li><p>How complex are the steps to complete this task? </p></li><li><p>What are the risks associated with this task? And, </p></li><li><p>When do you think you can have this ready? </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Negotiating effectively</p><p>For example, let’s imagine that the website designer estimates it will take them two weeks to mock up the website design for review. But perhaps you were hoping that the estimate might be closer to one week. </p><p>To arrive at an estimate that works for both you and the designer, you might gently challenge the estimate by asking follow-up questions. Perhaps you’d ask if their estimate includes mocking up designs for multiple pages. If so, you might ask if the designer is able to share one or two pages with you sooner than their proposed deadline. </p><p>By asking questions, you can determine if their estimate is flexible, or if you need to bring in an additional designer to support the schedule. By negotiating effectively with your teammates, you can create a sense of shared ownership over the project outcomes and create a schedule that aligns with everyone’s workload.</p></li><li><p>Practicing empathy</p><p>When you’re discussing estimates with the team, you might practice empathy by asking each person about their workload, including work outside of your project and the overall work-life balance.You might also ask if they’ve scheduled vacation or leave during the duration of the project, or if there are crucial holidays in which they won’t be working. This can help you avoid assigning tasks when teammates are unable to complete them on time.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

We have covered some common elements of project plans, including <em><strong>tasks, milestones, people, documentation, and time</strong></em>.</p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/master/images/image-20211030194135814.2nmhkwusbu8.png"                      style="zoom:50%;"                 ><h2 id="Project-scope-and-goals"><a href="#Project-scope-and-goals" class="headerlink" title="Project scope and goals"></a><strong>Project scope and goals</strong></h2><p>Both the project scope and goals will be captured initially in your <strong>project charter</strong>, the document that clearly defines the key details of your project. You can link your project charter in your project plan. Having details about the project’s scope and goals easily accessible can help remind your team of the objectives they are trying to accomplish and if anything is asked of them that goes beyond what was initially agreed upon in order to achieve those objectives. </p><h2 id="Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS"><a href="#Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS" class="headerlink" title="Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)"></a><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong></h2><p>As a reminder, a <strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong> is a tool that sorts the <em><strong>milestones and tasks</strong></em> of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.  The WBS is key to your project plan since it breaks the work down into more manageable pieces. In your project plan, the tasks should be visible in one place with clear descriptions, owners, and due dates. This will allow you and your team to understand who is responsible for which tasks and when each task is supposed to be completed. Your project plan should also contain detailed milestones and statuses related to these tasks, which will help you and your team members visualize project progress. </p><p>In addition to the WBS, further documentation—such as a RACI chart—will help define roles and responsibilities and would be useful to add to your project plan. Keeping this documentation stored or linked in one place is a best practice for transparency and effective communication.</p><h2 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a><strong>Budget</strong></h2><p>Throughout the life cycle of your project, the budget will need to be managed and monitored. The project budget is often linked to the project plan because it is heavily dependent on key elements of the project. Linking these components allows for smoother management and visibility. </p><p>Depending on the size of your project and your organization, you may not be the primary person responsible for managing the project budget. For instance, if your project is at a large organization and the funds are managed by another department, you may not have as much autonomy or insight into all of the budget elements. As a result, you may not be able to monitor the budget closely. If someone in another department is managing the budget, make sure to have regular check-ins with them to ensure that you are aware of how you are tracking.</p><h2 id="Management-plans"><a href="#Management-plans" class="headerlink" title="Management plans"></a><strong>Management plans</strong></h2><p>Management plans—such as the change management plan, risk management plan, and communication plan—are all integral to keeping a project organized and on track and should be linked in your project plan. These plans will be discussed in detail in the coming lessons of this course. </p>]]></content>

In order to reach a milestone, my team must complete multiple tasks. For example, when we want to do a mid-term presentation about our project, tasks may include brainstorm, creating a PPT,  and practice then pre-record.Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project tracking.</p><h2 id="The-importance-of-setting-milestones"><a href="#The-importance-of-setting-milestones" class="headerlink" title="The importance of setting milestones"></a>The importance of setting milestones</h2><ul><li><em><strong>Setting milestons gives you a clear understanging of the amount of work your project will require.</strong></em> When break down the project into pieces of milestones, and then you may know the amount of tasks needed to be done. Actually, it’s much more easier to think, when conducting, we will know the true amount of work.</li><li><em><strong>Keep project on track.</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Milestones help uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals.</strong></em> For example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you’d anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number of tasks.</li><li><em><strong>Reaching milestones can seiously motivate your team, and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders.</strong></em> </li><li>Milestones also server as agreat check-in point to highlight your progress to <em><strong>stakeholders</strong></em>. Give them a clear view of what have been done and the progress is on time. Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-set-milestones"><a href="#How-to-set-milestones" class="headerlink" title="How to set milestones?"></a>How to set milestones?</h2><p><em><strong>The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole.</strong></em> It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that goal.  Once you’ve determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline. To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take. When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders.</p><h3 id="Set-tasks-to-identify-milestones"><a href="#Set-tasks-to-identify-milestones" class="headerlink" title="Set tasks to identify milestones"></a>Set tasks to identify milestones</h3><p>Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Top-down scheduling:</strong> In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.</li><li><strong>Bottom-up scheduling:</strong> In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone. </li></ol><h3 id="Milestone-setting-pitfalls"><a href="#Milestone-setting-pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Milestone-setting pitfalls"></a><strong>Milestone-setting pitfalls</strong></h3><p>Here are some things to avoid when setting milestones: </p><ul><li><strong>Don’t set too many milestones</strong>. When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders. </li><li><strong>Don’t mistake tasks for milestones</strong>. Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.</li><li><strong>Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.</strong> Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones. </li></ul><h2 id="Creating-a-work-breakdown-structure"><a href="#Creating-a-work-breakdown-structure" class="headerlink" title="Creating a work breakdown structure"></a>Creating a work breakdown structure</h2><h3 id="Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS"><a href="#Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS" class="headerlink" title="Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)"></a>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3><p>A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.</p><p>It makes it easier to understand all of the essential project tasks, such as estimating costs, developing a schedule, assigning roles and responsibilities, and tracking progress. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/master/images/image-20211029100339396.1ta218aruz40.png"                      alt="WBS"                ></p><ul><li><p><strong>Start with the high-level, overarching project picture.

Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,” “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.</strong> Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. </p></li><li><p><strong>Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.</strong> Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on. </p></li></ul><p>Tips:</p><ul><li>To assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into consideration each person’s familiarity with the tasks at hand.</li><li>When assigning tasks, you should also consider each teammate’s workload.</li><li>As the project manager, you will ensure that your teammates are clear on their assigned tasks.

Your team will use this plan for ongoing maintenance of the Plant Pals service. It will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. The project will begin before the Plant Pals launch and extend beyond it.</p><p>The Operations team is responsible for managing the organization’s day-to-day business so that it continues to run smoothly. Operations provides resources to other departments, ensures consistency, and maintains the company’s profitability. The Chief Operations Officer (COO) typically leads the Operations team and works closely with other divisions, such as Sales, Client Services, Human Resources, Information Technology (IT), as well as the project manager. </p><p>Developing the Operations and Training plan marks a new stage of the project, with its own set of goals and deliverables. After assessing the requirements for the plan you determine three major milestones:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Select and install supply chain management software and equipment</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Develop and launch an employee training program</strong></em></li></ul><p>For each milestone, you divide the work into three separate tasks. Each task has its own owner, duration, and details. The tasks associated with your milestones include: </p><ul><li><strong>Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan</strong>: Team members will need to source materials for packaging and hire delivery drivers. They are also responsible for calculating the delivery fees. </li><li><strong>Select and install supply chain software and equipment</strong>: Team members will supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software. They must also supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment and determine internal safety protocols for the equipment.</li><li><strong>Develop and launch an employee training program</strong>: Team members will need to develop training sessions, train employees to use the software and equipment, and monitor progress and improve training processes.</li></ul><p>My trial:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11ZFVH7-HgzbNIiKM_Y7OqxhbzVTh51lzGx8UOfJB8oo/edit#slide=id.p1" >Use a WBS to create project tasks and milestones - Part 1<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fx8Nfa2c5S8oRhKYEw2_vZ4enxRSF-DdijcccmpWtE4/edit#gid=185434937" >Use a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>Google’ reference:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MPh9B1R4AIGjfTP24mn0LF5wPbQCEbWsT_-bKf_aBxc/edit?resourcekey=0-E9l5CNEj7B3oZ-RwseXyRA#slide=id.ge7313b124a_0_0" >WBS Brainstorm Diagram<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DesMW3hmpzocK-wQqZQ-modRzSFJYyZOQTF49J23Q08/edit#gid=0" >Use a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>The director recommend Asana as a tool to develop WBS, but not free for students outside the US right now.
