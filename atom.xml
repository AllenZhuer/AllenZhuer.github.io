For example, the time I write this note is about one hour(active time), but I should spend time on learning, watching the vedio, building my knowledge, and thinking the way how to write it, etc.    </li></ul></li><li><p>Unrealistic effort estiamtion: Happens when you underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete the task. Often, the culprit for under estimating effort is optimism. And listen, optimism is a wonderful trait for a project manager to possess. But too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that could set your plans behind schedule. </p><ul><li><p>How to avoid unrealistic effort estimation?</p><p>Your teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task and should be able to provide you with the best estimate.</p><p>Asking the teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation since they’ll have a deeper understanding of the work and the nuances of what’s required to complete the task.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Buffer: Extra time added to the end of task or project to account for unexpected slowdown or delays in work progress.</p><ul><li><p>Task buffer: Extra time tacked on to a specific task.</p><p>Task buffers should be used primarily for tasks out of team’s control. For example, when my team needs to buy some materials, the time that good shipped from the vendor to my company may delay one or two days.Task buffers should be used more sparingly for tasks within the project team’s control.</p></li><li><p>Project buffer: Adding a buffer to every task could lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily, leaving you, your team, and your stakeholders with an unrealistic timeline. This is where project buffers come in handy. Project buffers differ from task buffers in that they provide extra time to the overall project schedule.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="Run-fast-pay-later-A-case-study-on-time-estimation"><a href="#Run-fast-pay-later-A-case-study-on-time-estimation" class="headerlink" title="Run fast, pay later: A case study on time estimation"></a><strong>Run fast, pay later: A case study on time estimation</strong></h2><p>Kendra just scored a project manager role on a new project. It was a highly competitive bid, and the company and Kendra are eager to do a great job.</p><p>Kendra realized immediately that the timeline for the project would be almost impossible to execute. However, this was the first big project she was asked to manage. Therefore, instead of letting management know about the project’s impossible timeline, Kendra kept quiet and was determined to make it work. She rushed through the planning phase to get the team moving since time was ticking towards the project completion date. Kendra created all of the planning documents without input from her team or other stakeholders, with the sole intention of reaching the deadline.</p><p>During the team meeting, Kendra presented her project plan to the team. Right away, team members expressed their concerns with the timeline. They felt like there wasn’t enough time to complete their work, and they worried that the timeline didn’t incorporate enough time for reviews. Kendra documented the team’s concerns, but instructed them to simply work faster and make it happen.</p><p>As the project went on, the project faced schedule delays and other issues due to rework, previously unaccounted for tasks, stressed team members, and concerned stakeholders. Ultimately, the project missed its deadline. Later, the company did a retrospective to determine where things went wrong, and Kendra learned a lot of important lessons.</p><h3 id="Analysis-of-the-case"><a href="#Analysis-of-the-case" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of the case:"></a>Analysis of the case:</h3><h4 id="Escalating-concerns"><a href="#Escalating-concerns" class="headerlink" title="Escalating concerns"></a><strong>Escalating concerns</strong></h4><p>Kendra realized the timeline is problematic at the beginning. Instead of communicating with team members and stakeholders, and sharing the info, she decided to keep the issue to herself. She moved fast to meet the timeline instead of slowing down and planning the project throughly.</p><h4 id="Working-carefully"><a href="#Working-carefully" class="headerlink" title="Working carefully"></a><strong>Working carefully</strong></h4><p>If Kendra had taken the time to work carefully through the planning process, she may have been able to build a more realistic project plan to deliver the best product to the customer. She might also have identified potential time-saving activities that could have helped her team meet the project deadline. Thorough and careful planning with her team could have helped Kendra identify problems and solutions in advance, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Elimination of tasks</strong>. It is possible that all of the tasks initially listed didn’t need to be completed. There may have been unnecessary work added in, and the team could have completed the project without it.</li><li><strong>Increased team size</strong>. Kendra could have addressed the potential schedule risk by requesting more resources like team members and budget early on in the project rather than trying to execute without the necessary resources.</li><li><strong>Streamlining of activities</strong>. There may have been some tasks that could have been done in parallel, or at least not in sequential order.</li></ul><h4 id="Gathering-input-from-the-team"><a href="#Gathering-input-from-the-team" class="headerlink" title="Gathering input from the team"></a><strong>Gathering input from the team</strong></h4><p>Kendra should have brought together team members, peers, and management to help build and review her project plan, especially given the challenges of meeting the proposed project timeline. Kendra also didn’t take action to address the concerns of the team members who were responsible for completing the tasks within the estimated time. </p><h3 id="Scenario-Time-estimation"><a href="#Scenario-Time-estimation" class="headerlink" title="Scenario: Time estimation"></a>Scenario: Time estimation</h3><p>Consider the following scenario: You are to oversee the project for a new text book release for the fall semester. You’ve done something similar before, so you feel confident speaking with the stakeholders, project sponsor, and faculty director. You assure them the project will meet the 6-month deadline.</p><p>Around three months into the project, you notice that your writers consistently miss the writing deadlines you assign. Then you learn that a printer upgrade may delay printing the text books. Unfortunately, you forgot to include this delay in your time estimation. Now you have to tell the stakeholders that the project may not launch in time for fall. </p><p>What might you do differently next time to improve the outcome of this situation?</p><ul><li>Before the project launch, we should talk with the writer to get an accurate time to finish the task.</li><li>The printer upgrade is a task out of project team’s control, so task buffer should be taken into consideration. Additionally, when the project manager first learns about the printer issue, we should immediately update the time estimation and inform stakeholders.</li><li>The project manager can also look towards potential time saving activities, including: eliminate tasks, increase the team size to get more work done and meet the deadline, and streamline any of the activities in order to complete them in parallel with other tasks.</li><li>All-in-all, it’s important to perform time estimation, effort estimation, and add buffers to build realistic plans for reaching the project goal and ultimately, success!</li></ul><h2 id="Capacity-planning-and-the-critical-path"><a href="#Capacity-planning-and-the-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="Capacity planning and the critical path"></a>Capacity planning and the critical path</h2><h3 id="What-is-capacity-planning-and-critical-path"><a href="#What-is-capacity-planning-and-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="What is capacity planning and critical path"></a>What is capacity planning and critical path</h3><p>Capacity: the amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of time. In short, A man can only do so much, so when assign work, try to take capacity into consideration.</p><p>Capacity planning: Capacity planning refers to the act of allocating people, and resources to project tasks. And determining whether or not you have the necessary resources required to complete the work on time.</p><p>Here is a delivery example, one company sets their goal to ship 1000 bags to 8 areas in 4 days, and one courier can finish one area even if he spends all-day on his work, so two courier are needed for this mission. The capacity planning is to ensure enough people and resources to the task. It’s important to have a clear tasks and milestone, and then here comes the critical path.</p><p>Critical path: the list of project milestones that you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule. As well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. Your critical path includes the bare minimum number of tasks and milestones you need to reach your project goal. </p><p>Then what we should do is to go back to WBS and set estimates on how long it will take to finish these tasks, from when to when. </p><h3 id="What-may-affect-critical-path"><a href="#What-may-affect-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="What may affect critical path?"></a>What may affect critical path?</h3><ul><li><p>Identify which tasks can happen in parallel VS. which tasks can happen in sequentially.</p><p>Follow the delivery project. They have to hire two couriers before they ship these bags, so find tasks happened in sequentially can give priority to these tasks. At the same time, the company can push other tasks like mock up the design and test to develop a new website.</p></li><li><p>Determine which tasks have a fixed start date.</p><p>A fixed start date refers to the date on which you must start work on your task in order to achieve your goal. If you plan to start the ship on Tuesday, then maybe get all bags ready on Monday.</p></li><li><p>Determine which tasks have an early start date.</p></li><li><p>Identify if the task has a <em>float</em>. (also called slack) Float refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule, and threatens the project outcome. This helps identify what is not on your critical path. For instance, tasks on the critical path should have zero float, meaning there is no room for delays.  If you plan delivery on a specific date, then zero float for  this task.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Why-the-critical-path-is-critical"><a href="#Why-the-critical-path-is-critical" class="headerlink" title="Why the critical path is critical?"></a>Why the critical path is critical?</h3><p>The critical path helps you determine <em><strong>the essential tasks</strong></em> that need to be completed on your project to meet your end goal and <em><strong>how long each task will take</strong></em>. The critical path also provides a quick reference for critical tasks by revealing which tasks will impact your project completion date negatively if their scheduled finish dates are late or missed. A critical path can help you define the resources you need, your project baselines, and any flexibility you have in the schedule.</p><h3 id="How-to-create-a-critical-path"><a href="#How-to-create-a-critical-path" class="headerlink" title="How to create a critical path?"></a>How to create a critical path?</h3><p>Step 1: <strong>Capture all tasks</strong>.  Make a list of all tasks related to the project, you can refer to previous documents like <strong>WBS</strong>. Here is an exaple to build the structure of a house. </p><table><thead><tr><th align="left"><strong>Task</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">A) Excavation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B) Foundation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">C) Framing</td></tr><tr><td align="left">D) Roof</td></tr><tr><td align="left">E) Plumbing</td></tr><tr><td align="left">F) Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">G) Electrical</td></tr><tr><td align="left">H) Insulation</td></tr><tr><td align="left">I) Drywall + Paint</td></tr><tr><td align="left">J) Flooring</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Step 2: <strong>Set dependencies</strong>. Figure out which tasks must be completed before other tasks can start.

Visualize the critical path is by creating a <strong>network diagram</strong>.</p><ul><li>The path of the work from the start of the project (excavation) to the end of the project (flooring)</li><li>Which tasks can be performed in parallel (e.g., HVAC and plumbing) and in sequence (e.g., plumbing then insulation)</li><li>Which non-essential tasks are NOT on the critical path</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/master/images/1.49mbhk3tswy.svg"                      alt="A network diagram showing the critical path of tasks for building a house"                ></p><p>Step 4: <strong>Make time estimate</strong>.

These techniques are useful if you are asked to identify the <strong>earliest and latest start dates</strong> (the earliest and latest dates on which you can begin working on a task) or the <strong>slack</strong> (the amount of time that task can be delayed past its earliest start date without delaying the project).</p><ul><li>The <strong>forward pass</strong> refers to when you start at the beginning of your project task list and add up the duration of the tasks on the critical path to the end of your project. When using this approach, start with the first task you have identified that needs to be completed before anything else can start. </li><li>The <strong>backward pass</strong> is the opposite—start with the final task or milestone and move backwards through your schedule to determine the shortest path to completion. When there is a hard deadline, working backwards can help you determine which tasks are actually critical. You may be able to cut some tasks—or complete them later—in order to meet your deadline. </li></ul><p>Further reading:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.workamajig.com/blog/critical-path-method" >How to Use the Critical Path Method for Complete Beginners<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.wrike.com/blog/critical-path-is-easy-as-123/" >Critical Path Method: A Project Management Essential<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team"><a href="#Getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team" class="headerlink" title="Getting accurate time estimates from your team"></a>Getting accurate time estimates from your team</h2><p>When you try to estimate the time for tasks, it is the stage to get all your team members in, by a two-way discussion, and you’ll need to tap into your soft skills to get the most accurate estimate from your team.</p><p>Soft skills: personal characteristics that help people work effectively with others.</p><p>Soft skills for accurate estimation:</p><ul><li><p>Asking the right questions</p><p>Ask open-ended questions.

But perhaps you were hoping that the estimate might be closer to one week. </p><p>To arrive at an estimate that works for both you and the designer, you might gently challenge the estimate by asking follow-up questions. Perhaps you’d ask if their estimate includes mocking up designs for multiple pages. If so, you might ask if the designer is able to share one or two pages with you sooner than their proposed deadline. </p><p>By asking questions, you can determine if their estimate is flexible, or if you need to bring in an additional designer to support the schedule. By negotiating effectively with your teammates, you can create a sense of shared ownership over the project outcomes and create a schedule that aligns with everyone’s workload.</p></li><li><p>Practicing empathy</p><p>When you’re discussing estimates with the team, you might practice empathy by asking each person about their workload, including work outside of your project and the overall work-life balance.You might also ask if they’ve scheduled vacation or leave during the duration of the project, or if there are crucial holidays in which they won’t be working. This can help you avoid assigning tasks when teammates are unable to complete them on time.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

We have covered some common elements of project plans, including <em><strong>tasks, milestones, people, documentation, and time</strong></em>.</p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/master/images/image-20211030194135814.2nmhkwusbu8.png"                      style="zoom:50%;"                 ><h2 id="Project-scope-and-goals"><a href="#Project-scope-and-goals" class="headerlink" title="Project scope and goals"></a><strong>Project scope and goals</strong></h2><p>Both the project scope and goals will be captured initially in your <strong>project charter</strong>, the document that clearly defines the key details of your project. You can link your project charter in your project plan. Having details about the project’s scope and goals easily accessible can help remind your team of the objectives they are trying to accomplish and if anything is asked of them that goes beyond what was initially agreed upon in order to achieve those objectives. </p><h2 id="Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS"><a href="#Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS" class="headerlink" title="Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)"></a><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong></h2><p>As a reminder, a <strong>Work Breakdown Structure</strong> is a tool that sorts the <em><strong>milestones and tasks</strong></em> of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.  The WBS is key to your project plan since it breaks the work down into more manageable pieces. In your project plan, the tasks should be visible in one place with clear descriptions, owners, and due dates. This will allow you and your team to understand who is responsible for which tasks and when each task is supposed to be completed. Your project plan should also contain detailed milestones and statuses related to these tasks, which will help you and your team members visualize project progress. </p><p>In addition to the WBS, further documentation—such as a RACI chart—will help define roles and responsibilities and would be useful to add to your project plan. Keeping this documentation stored or linked in one place is a best practice for transparency and effective communication.</p><h2 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a><strong>Budget</strong></h2><p>Throughout the life cycle of your project, the budget will need to be managed and monitored. The project budget is often linked to the project plan because it is heavily dependent on key elements of the project. Linking these components allows for smoother management and visibility. </p><p>Depending on the size of your project and your organization, you may not be the primary person responsible for managing the project budget. For instance, if your project is at a large organization and the funds are managed by another department, you may not have as much autonomy or insight into all of the budget elements. As a result, you may not be able to monitor the budget closely. If someone in another department is managing the budget, make sure to have regular check-ins with them to ensure that you are aware of how you are tracking.</p><h2 id="Management-plans"><a href="#Management-plans" class="headerlink" title="Management plans"></a><strong>Management plans</strong></h2><p>Management plans—such as the change management plan, risk management plan, and communication plan—are all integral to keeping a project organized and on track and should be linked in your project plan. These plans will be discussed in detail in the coming lessons of this course. </p>]]></content>

In order to reach a milestone, my team must complete multiple tasks. For example, when we want to do a mid-term presentation about our project, tasks may include brainstorm, creating a PPT,  and practice then pre-record.Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project tracking.</p><h2 id="The-importance-of-setting-milestones"><a href="#The-importance-of-setting-milestones" class="headerlink" title="The importance of setting milestones"></a>The importance of setting milestones</h2><ul><li><em><strong>Setting milestons gives you a clear understanging of the amount of work your project will require.</strong></em> When break down the project into pieces of milestones, and then you may know the amount of tasks needed to be done. Actually, it’s much more easier to think, when conducting, we will know the true amount of work.</li><li><em><strong>Keep project on track.</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Milestones help uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals.</strong></em> For example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you’d anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number of tasks.</li><li><em><strong>Reaching milestones can seiously motivate your team, and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders.</strong></em> </li><li>Milestones also server as agreat check-in point to highlight your progress to <em><strong>stakeholders</strong></em>. Give them a clear view of what have been done and the progress is on time. Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-set-milestones"><a href="#How-to-set-milestones" class="headerlink" title="How to set milestones?"></a>How to set milestones?</h2><p><em><strong>The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole.</strong></em> It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that goal.  Once you’ve determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline. To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take. When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders.</p><h3 id="Set-tasks-to-identify-milestones"><a href="#Set-tasks-to-identify-milestones" class="headerlink" title="Set tasks to identify milestones"></a>Set tasks to identify milestones</h3><p>Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:</p><ol><li><strong>Top-down scheduling:</strong> In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.</li><li><strong>Bottom-up scheduling:</strong> In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone. </li></ol><h3 id="Milestone-setting-pitfalls"><a href="#Milestone-setting-pitfalls" class="headerlink" title="Milestone-setting pitfalls"></a><strong>Milestone-setting pitfalls</strong></h3><p>Here are some things to avoid when setting milestones: </p><ul><li><strong>Don’t set too many milestones</strong>. When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders. </li><li><strong>Don’t mistake tasks for milestones</strong>. Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.</li><li><strong>Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.</strong> Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones. </li></ul><h2 id="Creating-a-work-breakdown-structure"><a href="#Creating-a-work-breakdown-structure" class="headerlink" title="Creating a work breakdown structure"></a>Creating a work breakdown structure</h2><h3 id="Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS"><a href="#Work-Breakdown-Structure-WBS" class="headerlink" title="Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)"></a>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</h3><p>A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.</p><p>It makes it easier to understand all of the essential project tasks, such as estimating costs, developing a schedule, assigning roles and responsibilities, and tracking progress. </p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenZhuer/image-hosting/master/images/image-20211029100339396.1ta218aruz40.png"                      alt="WBS"                ></p><ul><li><p><strong>Start with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.</strong> Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,” “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.</strong> Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. </p></li><li><p><strong>Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.</strong> Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on. </p></li></ul><p>Tips:</p><ul><li>To assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into consideration each person’s familiarity with the tasks at hand.</li><li>When assigning tasks, you should also consider each teammate’s workload.</li><li>As the project manager, you will ensure that your teammates are clear on their assigned tasks.

Your team will use this plan for ongoing maintenance of the Plant Pals service. It will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. The project will begin before the Plant Pals launch and extend beyond it.</p><p>The Operations team is responsible for managing the organization’s day-to-day business so that it continues to run smoothly. Operations provides resources to other departments, ensures consistency, and maintains the company’s profitability. The Chief Operations Officer (COO) typically leads the Operations team and works closely with other divisions, such as Sales, Client Services, Human Resources, Information Technology (IT), as well as the project manager. </p><p>Developing the Operations and Training plan marks a new stage of the project, with its own set of goals and deliverables. After assessing the requirements for the plan you determine three major milestones:</p><ul><li><em><strong>Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Select and install supply chain management software and equipment</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Develop and launch an employee training program</strong></em></li></ul><p>For each milestone, you divide the work into three separate tasks. Each task has its own owner, duration, and details. The tasks associated with your milestones include: </p><ul><li><strong>Establish a plant delivery and logistics plan</strong>: Team members will need to source materials for packaging and hire delivery drivers. They are also responsible for calculating the delivery fees. </li><li><strong>Select and install supply chain software and equipment</strong>: Team members will supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software. They must also supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment and determine internal safety protocols for the equipment.</li><li><strong>Develop and launch an employee training program</strong>: Team members will need to develop training sessions, train employees to use the software and equipment, and monitor progress and improve training processes.</li></ul><p>My trial:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11ZFVH7-HgzbNIiKM_Y7OqxhbzVTh51lzGx8UOfJB8oo/edit#slide=id.p1" >Use a WBS to create project tasks and milestones - Part 1<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fx8Nfa2c5S8oRhKYEw2_vZ4enxRSF-DdijcccmpWtE4/edit#gid=185434937" >Use a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>Google’ reference:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MPh9B1R4AIGjfTP24mn0LF5wPbQCEbWsT_-bKf_aBxc/edit?resourcekey=0-E9l5CNEj7B3oZ-RwseXyRA#slide=id.ge7313b124a_0_0" >WBS Brainstorm Diagram<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DesMW3hmpzocK-wQqZQ-modRzSFJYyZOQTF49J23Q08/edit#gid=0" >Use a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2<i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p><p>The director recommend Asana as a tool to develop WBS, but not free for students outside the US right now.
