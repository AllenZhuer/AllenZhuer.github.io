[{"title":"A beginner journey to DeFi","url":"/2022/09/12/A-beginner-journey-to-DeFi/","content":"A beginner’s journey to DeFiEntering into the DeFi world can be exceting but also confusing. For now, in the bear market, it’s a good time to learn. If you jump in the sea of Dapps without the knowledge, it’s easy to make some unwise investment decisions. The best way to get involved is to learn the risks and find what’s suitable for you. Here are my basic learning in DeFi.\nThe history of FinanceThe earliest form of market exchange was peer to peer, also known as barter. At that time, if you wanted to trade two goats for a cow, you needed to find someone who owned the cow and was willing to get two goats. Barter was highly inefficient because it’s difficult to get the match. To solve this problem, money was introduced as a medium of exchange unit of account, and store of value. Some of them can be stones or shells. Similarly, the checks that led the trend of cashless transactions three centuries ago is also a breakthrough for fintech in the paper money era. Over the last century, we have had countless other innovations, ATM machines, online banking and transactions, wire transfers, and more, that have continued to evolve the way finance works. Importantly, these innovations were built on the backbone of centralized finance. While there may been some tech advances, the structure of today’s banking system has not changed much in the past century. To solve the problems in the existing finance system, decentralized finance was introduced to the stage.\nProblems in centralized financial systemsFor centuries, we have lived in a world of centralized finance. Central banks control the money supply. Financial transactions are mainly done through intermediaries or middle services providers. Lending is done through traditional banking institutions. However, DeFi introduces a way that peers interact with peers via a common ledger not controlled by any other cnetralized companies or organizations. And it can provide some potential for solving some problems associated with the centralized finance.\n\nCentralized control.  Centralization can be common in many countries, espically in China. Most people will be the clients of one or two banks, which can control the rates and fees especially in some localized banks. And this phenomenon spreads to some tech gaints plays leading roles in the fintech field like the Wechat Pay of Tencent, Alipay of Alibaba. Centralized control brings some other problems. Take WeChat Pay as an example. WeChat dominates the instant messaging market in mainland China, and even some international students from other countries video or text their parents in China. And WeChat Pay is a built-in feature of WeChat, which means that if your WeChat account is frozen due to some weird policy, you will not be able to control your funds in WeChat, which could lead to the death of startups that transfer money on WeChat.\nLimited Access. Some 1.7 billion adults worldwide still don’t have access to a bank account, according to data released by the World Bank. In addition to this, even with the account, you cannot access certain services because you have to meet certain requirements. For example, a bank may not want to bother with the small loan that a new business requires. However, in a DeFi world, the network, wallet address and some crypto currency are the only things needed to interact with hundreds of DApps. \nInefficient. An international students will suffer from the poor oversea services of international transfers, which may take serval days with a high intermediate fees. Time is wasted in the four days it takes to travel from one country to the other one. Other inefficiencies include costly (and slow) transfer of funds, direct and indirect brokerage fees, lack of security, and the inability to conduct microtransactions, many of which are not obvious to users.\nOpacity. The current financial system is not transparent. Banks may call you to introduce a loan after the down payment your new car. But you know little about the health of the bank. Something really bad happened in China this year, that clients cannot withdraw their funds from the bank. According to reports, at least tens of billions of RMB funds were involved, and about 400,000 depositors were affected. Apart from that, it’s difficult for clients to know if the rate is competitive when applying for a loan.\n\nWhat is DeFi?Ethereum (ETH) is currently the second largest cryptocurrency. Vitalik Buterin introduced the idea in 2014, and Ethereum mined its first block in 2015. Ethereum is in some sense a logical extension of the applications of Bitcoin because it allows for smart contracts which are code that lives on a blockchain, can control assets and data, and define interactions between the assets, data, and network participants. Ethereum and other smart contract platforms specifically gave rise to the decentralized application, or DApp. The drive toward financial DApps became the DeFi movement, which seeks to build create an open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem with minimized friction and maximized value to users. DeFi is fundamentally a competitive marketplace of financial dApps that function as various financial “primitives” such as exchange, lend, and tokenize. They benefit from the network effects of combining and recombining DeFi products and attracting increasingly more market share from the traditional financial ecosystem.\nDeFi primitivesTBC… This part will be shown in the blockchain understanding posts, which will be updated in the blog in a month.\nWhat are the potential use cases in DeFi?TBC…perfect these uses.\n\nLending and borrowing\nMakerDAO\nCompound\n\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\nUniswap\n\n\nDerivatives market\nTokenization \n\nChanllenges in DeFi\nPoor performance. Blockchains are inherently slower than their centralized counterparts, affecting applications built on top of them. Compared with Visa, which can handle upward of 65,000 TPS, Ethereum is capable of handling less than 0.1 percent of the throughput.\nHigh risk of user error. It can be difficult for newcomers to jump into the DeFi world and if the misuse occurs, it cannot be changed. DeFi ensures immutable operation but transform the responsibilities from the middle services providers to the end-user. It’s kind of the two sides of a coin. \nBad user experience. Why should we transfer from the existing system to a DeFi world if with bad experiences?How to attract more users? The answer is to improve ‘the easy to use’. What’s more, easy to understand. And the designs of most Dapps in mobile platforms are weak.\nBubbles. There are hundreds of products launching every day in the past few years, but few of them survived. \n\nWhat are the risks in DeFiWhile DeFi can eliminate counterparts risk, cutting out intermediators and allowing financial assets to be exchanged in a trustless way, all innovative tech will introduce new risks. \n\nSmart contract risk. DeFi is built on code. Since the public blockchian are open system, after deployed, all people can view and interact with it on a blockchain. And software is uniquely vulnerable to hacks and developer malpractice. Smart contract risk can take the form of a logic error in the code or an economic exploit in which an attacker can withdraw funds from the platform beyond the intended functionality. Code error can be easy to understand, but the economic can be tricky. There would be no explicit failure in the logic of the code but rather an opportunity for an economically equipped adversary to influence market conditions to profit inappropriately at the contract’s expense, like the flash attacks were executed in February 2020 on bZx Fulcrum. \n\nGovernance risk. There are some DeFi applications that are dependent on a human-governance process that actively adjusts protocol parameters to keep the system solvent. In which condition, users and investors must acquire a token that has been explicitly assigned rights on a liquid marketplace. Once acquired, holders use these tokens to vote on protocol changes and guide future direction. Governance tokens typically have a fixed supply, helping to resist any attempt by anyone to gain a majority (51%); however, they expose the protocol to the risk of being controlled by malicious actors. A governance attack can be the True Seigniorage Dollar(TSD).\n\nOracle. Fundamentally, oracles aim to connect the off-chain and on-chain info. Many DeFi protocols require access to secure, tamper-resistant asset prices to ensure that routine actions such as liquidations and prediction market resolutions function correctly. Protocol reliance on these data feeds introduces oracle risk. If an oracle’s cost of corruption is ever less than an attacker’s potential profit from corruption, the oracle is extremely vulnerable to attack.\n\nScaling. The proof of work consensus mechanisms used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum require a large amount of electricity for its computing power. To expect each miner to process all the financial transactions for a global financial market is unrealistic. And that can be the reason of high gas fee.  One solution can be the proof of stake, which replaces mining of blocks with staking an asset on the next block, with majority rules similar to proof of work. A user escrows funds in a smart contract and is subject to a penalty (slashed funds) if they deviate from expected behavior.  \nTODO: Solana and Layer-2 can be introduced here. \n\nRegulatory. As the DeFi market increases in size and influence, it will face greater regulatory scrutiny.  The legality of certain services and projects can be difficult to ascertain. If you are invested in a smart contract that is subsequently shut down due to regulatory problems, then your funds can be at risk. Currently, most blockchain projects are not allowed in China. But that won’t stop the enthusiasm of some Chinese tech advocates. A friend of mine is a user of a popular gamefi project called STEPN which came up with an idea “Run to Earn”. He told me that the floor price for an NFT can be 4 SOL. But STEPN has stopped serving in China since the Chinese regulation and lost more than 90% of its users, most of them Chinese, within a day. At that time, STEPN reportedly had more than 3 million daily active users.\n\n\n","tags":["DeFi","Blockchain"]},{"title":"C3_W1_P1_Uderstanding the planning phase componets","url":"/2021/11/13/C3-W1-P1_Uderstanding-the-planning-phase-componets/","content":"Notes: Project planing: put it all together.

Week 1\nCourse link : Project Planning: Putting It All Together\nDefining tasks and milestonesUnderstanding tasks and milestonesMilestone: an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.\nProject task: an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time.\nThe work of a project is broken down into many different tasks. In order to reach a milestone, my team must complete multiple tasks. For example, when we want to do a mid-term presentation about our project, tasks may include brainstorm, creating a PPT,  and practice then pre-record.Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project tracking.\nThe importance of setting milestones\nSetting milestons gives you a clear understanging of the amount of work your project will require. When break down the project into pieces of milestones, and then you may know the amount of tasks needed to be done. Actually, it’s much more easier to think, when conducting, we will know the true amount of work.\nKeep project on track.\nMilestones help uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals. For example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you’d anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number of tasks.\nReaching milestones can seiously motivate your team, and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders. \nMilestones also server as agreat check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders. Give them a clear view of what have been done and the progress is on time. Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order\n\nHow to set milestones?The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole. It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that goal.  Once you’ve determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline. To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take. When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders.\nSet tasks to identify milestonesSetting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:\n\nTop-down scheduling: In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.\nBottom-up scheduling: In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone. \n\nMilestone-setting pitfallsHere are some things to avoid when setting milestones: \n\nDon’t set too many milestones. When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders. \nDon’t mistake tasks for milestones. Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.\nDon’t list your milestones and tasks separately. Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones. \n\nCreating a work breakdown structureWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)A tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.\nIt makes it easier to understand all of the essential project tasks, such as estimating costs, developing a schedule, assigning roles and responsibilities, and tracking progress. \n\n\nStart with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones. Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,” “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”\n\nIdentify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones. Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. \n\nExamine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks. Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on. \n\n\nTips:\n\nTo assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into consideration each person’s familiarity with the tasks at hand.\nWhen assigning tasks, you should also consider each teammate’s workload.\nAs the project manager, you will ensure that your teammates are clear on their assigned tasks. Tool: Asana\nOne less obvious benefit of assigning tasks is that it creates a sense of personal responsibility for members of the team.\n8/80 rule: A work package should take no less than 8 hours, and also no more than 80 hours.\n\n Further Reading: How to Create a Work Breakdown Structure and Why You Should\nScenario:\nAs a project manager for Office Green, your job includes working with the operations team to develop and implement an Operations and Training plan. Your team will use this plan for ongoing maintenance of the Plant Pals service. It will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. The project will begin before the Plant Pals launch and extend beyond it.\nThe Operations team is responsible for managing the organization’s day-to-day business so that it continues to run smoothly. Operations provides resources to other departments, ensures consistency, and maintains the company’s profitability. The Chief Operations Officer (COO) typically leads the Operations team and works closely with other divisions, such as Sales, Client Services, Human Resources, Information Technology (IT), as well as the project manager. \nDeveloping the Operations and Training plan marks a new stage of the project, with its own set of goals and deliverables. After assessing the requirements for the plan you determine three major milestones:\n\nEstablish a plant delivery and logistics plan\nSelect and install supply chain management software and equipment\nDevelop and launch an employee training program\n\nFor each milestone, you divide the work into three separate tasks. Each task has its own owner, duration, and details. The tasks associated with your milestones include: \n\nEstablish a plant delivery and logistics plan: Team members will need to source materials for packaging and hire delivery drivers. They are also responsible for calculating the delivery fees. \nSelect and install supply chain software and equipment: Team members will supervise vendor setup of inventory management and fulfillment software. They must also supervise vendor installation of fulfillment equipment and determine internal safety protocols for the equipment.\nDevelop and launch an employee training program: Team members will need to develop training sessions, train employees to use the software and equipment, and monitor progress and improve training processes.\n\nMy trial:\nUse a WBS to create project tasks and milestones - Part 1\nUse a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2\nGoogle’ reference:\nWBS Brainstorm Diagram\nUse a WBS to create milestones and project tasks - Part 2\nThe director recommend Asana as a tool to develop WBS, but not free for students outside the US right now.

We have covered some common elements of project plans, including tasks, milestones, people, documentation, and time.\n\n\nProject scope and goalsBoth the project scope and goals will be captured initially in your project charter, the document that clearly defines the key details of your project. You can link your project charter in your project plan. Having details about the project’s scope and goals easily accessible can help remind your team of the objectives they are trying to accomplish and if anything is asked of them that goes beyond what was initially agreed upon in order to achieve those objectives. \nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS)As a reminder, a Work Breakdown Structure is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.  The WBS is key to your project plan since it breaks the work down into more manageable pieces. In your project plan, the tasks should be visible in one place with clear descriptions, owners, and due dates. This will allow you and your team to understand who is responsible for which tasks and when each task is supposed to be completed. Your project plan should also contain detailed milestones and statuses related to these tasks, which will help you and your team members visualize project progress. \nIn addition to the WBS, further documentation—such as a RACI chart—will help define roles and responsibilities and would be useful to add to your project plan. Keeping this documentation stored or linked in one place is a best practice for transparency and effective communication.\nBudgetThroughout the life cycle of your project, the budget will need to be managed and monitored. The project budget is often linked to the project plan because it is heavily dependent on key elements of the project. Linking these components allows for smoother management and visibility. \nDepending on the size of your project and your organization, you may not be the primary person responsible for managing the project budget. For instance, if your project is at a large organization and the funds are managed by another department, you may not have as much autonomy or insight into all of the budget elements. As a result, you may not be able to monitor the budget closely. If someone in another department is managing the budget, make sure to have regular check-ins with them to ensure that you are aware of how you are tracking.\nManagement plansManagement plans—such as the change management plan, risk management plan, and communication plan—are all integral to keeping a project organized and on track and should be linked in your project plan. These plans will be discussed in detail in the coming lessons of this course. \n","tags":["PM","Notes"]},{"title":"C3_W2_P3_Utilizing tools to build a project plan","url":"/2021/11/27/C3-W2-P3-Utilizing-tools-to-build-a-project-plan/","content":"Week2 Building a project plan part 3 \nCourse link : Project Planning: Putting It All Together\nUtilizing tools to build a project planDeveloping a project scheduleAn anchor of a good project plan is a clear schedule containing all the tasks of a project, their owners, and when they need to be completed. \nGantt chart: A horizontal bar chart that maps out a project schedule.

For example, the time I write this note is about one hour(active time), but I should spend time on learning, watching the vedio, building my knowledge, and thinking the way how to write it, etc.    \n\n\nUnrealistic effort estiamtion: Happens when you underestimate the amount of time it will take to complete the task. Often, the culprit for under estimating effort is optimism. And listen, optimism is a wonderful trait for a project manager to possess. But too much optimism can lead you to overlook potential risks that could set your plans behind schedule. \n\nHow to avoid unrealistic effort estimation?\nYour teammates will have the most realistic understanding of the amount of work required to complete a task and should be able to provide you with the best estimate.\nAsking the teammate assigned to the task for their estimate is likely to yield a more accurate estimation since they’ll have a deeper understanding of the work and the nuances of what’s required to complete the task.\n\n\n\nBuffer: Extra time added to the end of task or project to account for unexpected slowdown or delays in work progress.\n\nTask buffer: Extra time tacked on to a specific task.\nTask buffers should be used primarily for tasks out of team’s control. For example, when my team needs to buy some materials, the time that good shipped from the vendor to my company may delay one or two days.Task buffers should be used more sparingly for tasks within the project team’s control.\n\nProject buffer: Adding a buffer to every task could lengthen your project schedule unnecessarily, leaving you, your team, and your stakeholders with an unrealistic timeline. This is where project buffers come in handy. Project buffers differ from task buffers in that they provide extra time to the overall project schedule.\n\n\n\n\nRun fast, pay later: A case study on time estimationKendra just scored a project manager role on a new project. It was a highly competitive bid, and the company and Kendra are eager to do a great job.\nKendra realized immediately that the timeline for the project would be almost impossible to execute. However, this was the first big project she was asked to manage. Therefore, instead of letting management know about the project’s impossible timeline, Kendra kept quiet and was determined to make it work. She rushed through the planning phase to get the team moving since time was ticking towards the project completion date. Kendra created all of the planning documents without input from her team or other stakeholders, with the sole intention of reaching the deadline.\nDuring the team meeting, Kendra presented her project plan to the team. Right away, team members expressed their concerns with the timeline. They felt like there wasn’t enough time to complete their work, and they worried that the timeline didn’t incorporate enough time for reviews. Kendra documented the team’s concerns, but instructed them to simply work faster and make it happen.\nAs the project went on, the project faced schedule delays and other issues due to rework, previously unaccounted for tasks, stressed team members, and concerned stakeholders. Ultimately, the project missed its deadline. Later, the company did a retrospective to determine where things went wrong, and Kendra learned a lot of important lessons.\nAnalysis of the case:Escalating concernsKendra realized the timeline is problematic at the beginning. Instead of communicating with team members and stakeholders, and sharing the info, she decided to keep the issue to herself. She moved fast to meet the timeline instead of slowing down and planning the project throughly.\nWorking carefullyIf Kendra had taken the time to work carefully through the planning process, she may have been able to build a more realistic project plan to deliver the best product to the customer. She might also have identified potential time-saving activities that could have helped her team meet the project deadline. Thorough and careful planning with her team could have helped Kendra identify problems and solutions in advance, such as:\n\nElimination of tasks. It is possible that all of the tasks initially listed didn’t need to be completed. There may have been unnecessary work added in, and the team could have completed the project without it.\nIncreased team size. Kendra could have addressed the potential schedule risk by requesting more resources like team members and budget early on in the project rather than trying to execute without the necessary resources.\nStreamlining of activities. There may have been some tasks that could have been done in parallel, or at least not in sequential order.\n\nGathering input from the teamKendra should have brought together team members, peers, and management to help build and review her project plan, especially given the challenges of meeting the proposed project timeline. Kendra also didn’t take action to address the concerns of the team members who were responsible for completing the tasks within the estimated time. \nScenario: Time estimationConsider the following scenario: You are to oversee the project for a new text book release for the fall semester. You’ve done something similar before, so you feel confident speaking with the stakeholders, project sponsor, and faculty director. You assure them the project will meet the 6-month deadline.\nAround three months into the project, you notice that your writers consistently miss the writing deadlines you assign. Then you learn that a printer upgrade may delay printing the text books. Unfortunately, you forgot to include this delay in your time estimation. Now you have to tell the stakeholders that the project may not launch in time for fall. \nWhat might you do differently next time to improve the outcome of this situation?\n\nBefore the project launch, we should talk with the writer to get an accurate time to finish the task.\nThe printer upgrade is a task out of project team’s control, so task buffer should be taken into consideration. Additionally, when the project manager first learns about the printer issue, we should immediately update the time estimation and inform stakeholders.\nThe project manager can also look towards potential time saving activities, including: eliminate tasks, increase the team size to get more work done and meet the deadline, and streamline any of the activities in order to complete them in parallel with other tasks.\nAll-in-all, it’s important to perform time estimation, effort estimation, and add buffers to build realistic plans for reaching the project goal and ultimately, success!\n\nCapacity planning and the critical pathWhat is capacity planning and critical pathCapacity: the amount of work that the people or resources assigned to the project can reasonably complete in a set period of time. In short, A man can only do so much, so when assign work, try to take capacity into consideration.\nCapacity planning: Capacity planning refers to the act of allocating people, and resources to project tasks. And determining whether or not you have the necessary resources required to complete the work on time.\nHere is a delivery example, one company sets their goal to ship 1000 bags to 8 areas in 4 days, and one courier can finish one area even if he spends all-day on his work, so two courier are needed for this mission. The capacity planning is to ensure enough people and resources to the task. It’s important to have a clear tasks and milestone, and then here comes the critical path.\nCritical path: the list of project milestones that you must reach in order to meet the project goal on schedule. As well as the mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. Your critical path includes the bare minimum number of tasks and milestones you need to reach your project goal. \nThen what we should do is to go back to WBS and set estimates on how long it will take to finish these tasks, from when to when. \nWhat may affect critical path?\nIdentify which tasks can happen in parallel VS. which tasks can happen in sequentially.\nFollow the delivery project. They have to hire two couriers before they ship these bags, so find tasks happened in sequentially can give priority to these tasks. At the same time, the company can push other tasks like mock up the design and test to develop a new website.\n\nDetermine which tasks have a fixed start date.\nA fixed start date refers to the date on which you must start work on your task in order to achieve your goal. If you plan to start the ship on Tuesday, then maybe get all bags ready on Monday.\n\nDetermine which tasks have an early start date.\n\nIdentify if the task has a float. (also called slack) Float refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule, and threatens the project outcome. This helps identify what is not on your critical path. For instance, tasks on the critical path should have zero float, meaning there is no room for delays.  If you plan delivery on a specific date, then zero float for  this task.\n\n\nWhy the critical path is critical?The critical path helps you determine the essential tasks that need to be completed on your project to meet your end goal and how long each task will take. The critical path also provides a quick reference for critical tasks by revealing which tasks will impact your project completion date negatively if their scheduled finish dates are late or missed. A critical path can help you define the resources you need, your project baselines, and any flexibility you have in the schedule.\nHow to create a critical path?Step 1: Capture all tasks.  Make a list of all tasks related to the project, you can refer to previous documents like WBS. Here is an exaple to build the structure of a house. \n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nA) Excavation\n\n\nB) Foundation\n\n\nC) Framing\n\n\nD) Roof\n\n\nE) Plumbing\n\n\nF) Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)\n\n\nG) Electrical\n\n\nH) Insulation\n\n\nI) Drywall + Paint\n\n\nJ) Flooring\n\n\nStep 2: Set dependencies. Figure out which tasks must be completed before other tasks can start. Some questions may help a lot.\n\nWhich task needs to take place before this task?\nWhich task can be finished at the same time as this task?\nWhich task needs to happen right after this task?\n\n\n\n\nTask\nDependency\n\n\n\nA) Excavation\n\n\n\nB) Foundation\nA) Excavation\n\n\nC) Framing\nB) Foundation\n\n\nD) Roof\nC) Framing\n\n\nE) Plumbing\nC) Framing\n\n\nF) HVAC\nC) Framing\n\n\nG) Electrical\nC) Framing\n\n\nH) Insulation\nE) Plumbing, F) HVAC, G) Electrical\n\n\nI) Drywall + Paint\nH) Insulation\n\n\nJ) Flooring\nI) Drywall + Paint\n\n\nStep 3: Create a network diagram. Visualize the critical path is by creating a network diagram.\n\nThe path of the work from the start of the project (excavation) to the end of the project (flooring)\nWhich tasks can be performed in parallel (e.g., HVAC and plumbing) and in sequence (e.g., plumbing then insulation)\nWhich non-essential tasks are NOT on the critical path\n\n\nStep 4: Make time estimate. Consult key stakeholders to get accurate time estimates for each task. And update the network diagram.\n\n\n\nTask\nDuration\nDependency\n\n\n\nA) Excavation\n1 Day\n\n\n\nB) Foundation\n3 Days\nA) Excavation\n\n\nC) Framing\n15 Days\nB) Foundation\n\n\nD) Roof\n3 Days\nC) Framing\n\n\nE) Plumbing\n4 Days\nC) Framing\n\n\nF) HVAC\n3 Days\nC) Framing\n\n\nG) Electrical\n3 Days\nC) Framing\n\n\nH) Insulation\n2 Days\nE) Plumbing, F) HVAC, G) Electrical\n\n\nI) Drywall + Paint\n15 Days\nH) Insulation\n\n\nJ) Flooring\n7 Days\nI) Drywall + Paint\n\n\n\nStep 5: Find the Critical Path.\nYou can also calculate the critical path using two common approaches: the forward pass and the backward pass. These techniques are useful if you are asked to identify the earliest and latest start dates (the earliest and latest dates on which you can begin working on a task) or the slack (the amount of time that task can be delayed past its earliest start date without delaying the project).\n\nThe forward pass refers to when you start at the beginning of your project task list and add up the duration of the tasks on the critical path to the end of your project. When using this approach, start with the first task you have identified that needs to be completed before anything else can start. \nThe backward pass is the opposite—start with the final task or milestone and move backwards through your schedule to determine the shortest path to completion. When there is a hard deadline, working backwards can help you determine which tasks are actually critical. You may be able to cut some tasks—or complete them later—in order to meet your deadline. \n\nFurther reading:\n\nHow to Use the Critical Path Method for Complete Beginners\nCritical Path Method: A Project Management Essential\n\nGetting accurate time estimates from your teamWhen you try to estimate the time for tasks, it is the stage to get all your team members in, by a two-way discussion, and you’ll need to tap into your soft skills to get the most accurate estimate from your team.\nSoft skills: personal characteristics that help people work effectively with others.\nSoft skills for accurate estimation:\n\nAsking the right questions\nAsk open-ended questions. Take Office Green project as an example. You’ve discussed the design of the new website with your web designer, and you’d like to know how long it will take them to mock up designs for your review. \nCan you complete the mock-ups in one week? (Close-ended question with answer yes or no) May ask the following questions to learn more about how they work and what they do.\n\nHow long does it typically take you to mock up a website design like this one? \n\nHow complex are the steps to complete this task? \n\nWhat are the risks associated with this task? And, \n\nWhen do you think you can have this ready? \n\n\n\nNegotiating effectively\nFor example, let’s imagine that the website designer estimates it will take them two weeks to mock up the website design for review. But perhaps you were hoping that the estimate might be closer to one week. \nTo arrive at an estimate that works for both you and the designer, you might gently challenge the estimate by asking follow-up questions. Perhaps you’d ask if their estimate includes mocking up designs for multiple pages. If so, you might ask if the designer is able to share one or two pages with you sooner than their proposed deadline. \nBy asking questions, you can determine if their estimate is flexible, or if you need to bring in an additional designer to support the schedule. By negotiating effectively with your teammates, you can create a sense of shared ownership over the project outcomes and create a schedule that aligns with everyone’s workload.\n\nPracticing empathy\nWhen you’re discussing estimates with the team, you might practice empathy by asking each person about their workload, including work outside of your project and the overall work-life balance.You might also ask if they’ve scheduled vacation or leave during the duration of the project, or if there are crucial holidays in which they won’t be working. This can help you avoid assigning tasks when teammates are unable to complete them on time.\n\n\n","tags":["PM","Notes"]},{"title":"Doodles:An in-depth

guide\n这是一篇对于Doodles NFT项目总结的翻译，仅用作记录学习的过程，原文以及作者可以由上面的链接进行访问。\n我们深入研究的系列，都会将NFT项目分作不同的方面去评分，而每个方面以10分为满分，最后也会有一个10分为满分的总分。这样做可以量化项目的质素面，方便我们去比较不同的项目，从而得出我们认为合理的买入价。\n\nDoodles是一个以浅色柔和的色调的、总发行量有10,000张的个人页大头照类NFT项目。它最初在2021年3月登场，借着系列的表现和增长，之后很快就得到广泛的注意及「蓝筹共识」。现时它在Opensea上，总交易量的排名为第11名，地板价也来到了26 ETH。 Doodles蕴酿着一个欢乐、有趣而平易近人的社区，而这个品牌同时也很有野心，打算将Doodles发展为一个大型的变乐公司。\nDoodles项目也在艺术、创办人、社区为先的制度、在现实生活中的活动、历史表现以及创新，而时时受到青睐和赞美。\n重要资料:Doodles 发行日: 2021年3月17日总供应量: 10,000版税: 5%总交易量: 156k ETHOpensea 排名: #11\n重要链接:Website; Doodles Opensea; Discord; Contract; Space Doodles Opensea; Dooplicator Opensea\n\n艺术\n无容置疑，Doodles的艺术非常棒，也成为了令这项目成功的一大原因。在款式和颜色分级方面，非常独特，亦有一个很有连贯性的设计语言，令到它具有极高的辨识度。因此，Doodles成为了其中被抄袭和衍生品最多的一个项目 – 可见它的艺术对这个空间的影响力。\nDoodles有一万发行量的项目，当中都是以手绘1/1 (每个都独一无二)及超级稀有的头部、角色和衣物生成。\n它的粉彩色系和简洁的线条画工，突显出了作品的个性。而有些标志性的特征，包括「突出」的眼睛、彩虹呕吐物、便利贴脸，和胀卜卜的羽绒等。\n超级罕有的有猿猴、外星人、腌小黄瓜、骨架、汽球、冰棒、雪糕、火烧头，和不同动物形态的Doodles\n\n\n\nDoodles是非常出色的PFP，Twitter上为数不少的人将其设为个人头像，就充分证明了这点。\n背后的艺术家是一位加拿大的插画家、设计师和动画家，名叫Burnt Toast。 (Twitter; Instagram)\nBurnt Toast有一堆非常出色的作品集，包括了为Google, Whatsapp, Snapchat, Adobe, Dropbox, Red Bull和其他的过往杰作。\n他主要为这些客户设计贴图包。\n在Doodles随后的NFT (Space Doodles and Dooplicators)也很大程度地跟随它标志性的风格，新增的动画形式也提升了趣味性。\n艺术的质素在Web2上也呈现得非常好，无论是网站、DC和其他社交媒体，虚拟的元素无一不是以Doodles个性化高水准，表现在丰富的服饰艺术、动画、贴图包和emojis上。\nDoodles在艺术方面，是无可挑剔表现在现实上。品牌过去在NFT space中举办了几乎是最引人注目的实体活动，下文会在这方面作进一步说明\n\n\nDoodles在SXSW展览的入口处\nDoodles的艺术是标志性的，引领着NFT的潮流。它更完美地呈现在Doodles不同层次上的产品，由Web2的元素到实体展示都是如此。 Burnt Toast 成功地创造出一个自己的世界，也是Doodles的世界。 Doodles艺术上的表现，会根深柢固地把Doodles名留青史。\n评分 10/10\n团队创办人:\nDoodles有三位创办人: Evan Keast, Scott Martin (Burnt Toast), 和 Jordan Castro (Poopie)\nEvan Keast和Burnt Toast一样都是加拿大人。在加入 Doodles 之前，他曾担任营销人员和 NFT 顾问，曾在 Kabam Games、Dapper Labs 和 Crytpo Kitties 任职\nEvan Keast是 Dapper Labs 和 CryptoKitties 的前营销主管，Jordan Castro 是 Dapper Labs 的 Crypto Kitties 的前项目主管\nCryptoKitties 是一个 很早期的NFT项目——是一款由 Dapper Labs 开发的以太坊区块链游戏，在入面允许玩家购买、收集、繁殖和出售 NFT 猫。这是最早将区块链技术用于娱乐和休闲的尝试之一\nCryptoKitties 本身就是一个非常成功和创新的项目，并且在 2017 年初（CrytpoPunks 时代）就完成了这一切。他们发明了一些当今在NFT空间中广泛使用的技术，例如包装和培育 NFT\n他们很早就踏入了 NFT/web3 领域，更是重要的创新者。所以他们能在NFT空间中，实现第二个项目时就取得了如此巨大的成功，根本不意外\nJordan 己将自己的個人IG公开了\n他们在 Dapper Labs 取得的成功，可能意味着拒绝过 VC 融资的大好机会——这很重要，因为此举明示了他们对 web3 和去中心化的承诺，并进而为持有者带来价值\n\n智能合约工程师:\n总部位于温哥华的智能合约开发机构，WestCoastNFT，帮助推出了 Doodles。它有经验丰富的团队，专门从事定制的智能合约，在该领域拥有丰富的专业知识和经验\n它们开始的头 3 个月，帮助启动了 14 个 NFT 项目，包括 888、888, Secret Society of Whales、Based Fished Mafia、Boneheads 和 Doodles，均取得了巨大成功\n\n首席执行官:2022 年 5 月 6 日，Doodles 宣布任命 Billboard 前总裁 Julian Holguin，为 Doodles 首席执行官。这是一个令人印象深刻的举动，不论在 NFT 领域内外都引起了很多关注。\n\n\n\nHolguin 在领导 Billboard 的战略增长和创新方面拥有十多年的经验，并在 MRC Studios 和 NBC Universal 等大型媒体和娱乐品牌担任行政职务 14 年，是身经百战的老鹰\n迄今为止，由他的职业生涯可见，他在娱乐行业成功地扩大 IP 规模并从中获利，这使他非常适合 Doodles 的未来计划\nDoodles 表示，Holguin 的目标是通过音乐、游戏和娱乐来扩展 Doodles 的IP\n\nPharrell:\n在 NFT.NYC 2022 上，Doodles 宣布任命Pharrell Williams 为新的董事会成员和首席品牌官 (CBO)\n\n他们还宣布 Pharrell 将制作第一卷 Doodles 唱片\nhttps://twitter.com/Pharrell/status/1539427990668382210?ref_src=twsrc^tfw|twcamp^tweetembed|twterm^1539427990668382210|twgr^|twcon^s1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fpharrell%2Fstatus%2F1539427990668382210image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07\n\n\n***Doodles背后是非常强大的团队，亦有令人印象深刻的简历，包括早期在 NFT 领域的成功，及在娱乐品牌 IP 发展方面的经验。团队展示了远见卓识、真正的创新、充足的执行能力以及对NFT领域的深入了解\n\n评分 10/10\n社区\n社区是 Doodles 最大的卖点之一——Doodles是社区主导项目(community-led projects)的模范，并且一直是这方面的先驱\n\nDoodlebank:\nDoodlebank (DAO) 是该项目的社区国库，其创建目的是「扩大团队规模并进行各种试验尝试发展 Doodles 品牌」\n二次销售中所产生收入的 50%会发送到 Doodlebank 中成为它的资金\n资金中也由最初铸造 (mint) 获得了 420 ETH\n在撰写本文时，Doodlebank 中有 2,541 ETH；团队会定时更新资金规模和每笔交易，每周在 Discord 中发布出来\n持有者一个 Doodle 代表投 1 票投票权\n资金如何使用，完全由社区决定——每个持有人都可以提出新的建议、资金分配和战略方向的提案\n而提案从构思到实施有一个过程：\n\n点子：任何持有者，只要拥有自己热爱的想法，都可以成为Doodle Champion。想法会版发布在网站上的论坛中，并讨论。论坛的作用，是收集反馈、迭代和衡量想法的支持程度。\n初步提案：当一个想法准备好进入下一阶段时，Doodle Champion会在论坛中创建一个初步提案，并进行热度检查投票。提案必须有 15% 的投票率（1 Doodle = 1 Vote）才可进入下一阶段，因此必须有 1,500 票，并且必须获得多数选民的支持，才能获得资格。\n最终提案：一旦满足以上的要求，创始人就会将提案升级，尽可能多地保留原始提案的原意。但如果涉及法律或财务考虑，就有机会增加细节并重组提案。最终提案随后由创始人发布，而具体取决于执行提案所需的 ETH 多少，决定出投票率会在 5-15% 之间那个百分比。多票的提案决定最终落实的那一个。\n\nDoodlebank 提案成功并获得通过的例子如下：\n\n\n\nQ1 扩展体验预算的最终提案，最后获得Doodlebank的420 ETH，并以 99% 的多数票通过\n\n\n社交:\n不论在 Discord 和 Twitter 上，Doodles 都有一个非常活跃和友好的社区，对一些人来说，它的形像是更友好和更快乐版的BAYC 社区\n实体活动IRL:\n与 BAYC 一样，他们的IRL非常出色，使其在促进持有者之间的联系，和巩固社区方面，都发挥了重要作用。通过拉近 web3/IRL 的差距，Doodles 为其持有者提供了真实的体验，鼓励他们继续持有。\n一个很好的IRL例子是在 SXSW 2022 上的展览，活动支出由 Doodlebank 在上述提案中投票决定。\n\nSXSW 2022:\nSouth-by-south-west 是一个大型的艺术节目和给创作者的会议，每年吸引约 150,000 名参加者。\nDoodles 举办了一个互动展览，持有者可以免费使用，虽然持有SXSW 2022 门票的也可以使用，但有些部分设施只开放给 Doodles 持有者。\n他们的「植入式广告」包括一个由创作者组成的面板、一家礼品店、Doodles 艺术展示和其他互动和沈浸式装置，以及 Doodle 主题食品和点心，如 Doodle Coffee、Noodle Bar（由 Noodles 主办）和 Doodle Popsicle bar（见下面的视频）\n\nDoodles 持有者可与创始人的在一边聊天，其中包括 Burnt Toast、Tulip、Poopie 和 Matt Medved，更可参加有特别嘉宾出席的晚宴。\n\n\n\n大量的头条新闻和宣传都报导了Doodles展览，并在多数媒体中受到好评。\n\nDoodles 有一个非常热情、活跃和友好的社区，是真正意义上的社区主导的项目。出色的 IRL 活动更进一步将社区凝聚在一起。\n评分 9.75/10\n历史表现\n\n该项目于 3 月 17 日发出白名单，并于 3 月 18 日向公众发售，两种情况下的铸造价均为 0.123——当时来说价格非常高。不过，考虑到创始人的背书，及其艺术背后的炒作潜力，该系列的成功完售。\n\n炒作导致了公众发售时的Gas War，用户一般只需付 3-5 ETH 的交易费用来铸造最多5 个Doodles。 Gas War令到公众发售阶段，每个 Doodle 连gas fee需支付接近 1 ETH。\n\n人们愿意在 gas 上花这么多钱，以及高于 1 ETH的限时底价，都在反映了他们对项目的信念\n\n然而，在公开发行之后，价格跌至 0.8 ETH 左右，该水平大约在项目的第一周保持不变，这意味着许多在公开发售中铸造的人并没有立即获利。\n\n在第二周开始，底价开始上升，在 10 月 24 日当地 ATH为 1.9 ETH。\n\n对于项目的前4周，底价基本在 1.8 ETH 之间波动，间中暂时会低于 1 ETH。然而在 11 月 18 日之前的 5 天内，底价从 0.9 ETH 急剧上升至 3.3 ETH。然后，在其发布的第二个月时，底价在 2-3 ETH 之间波动。\n\n12 月 14 日，底价又开始抽升，这一次直接将ATH 升到 1 月 12 日的 13.5 ETH 的高点。这种急剧增长可以说是当时NFT 市场走出熊市的转捩点，并进入一个非常看涨的一月。许多已存在的项目在此期间也表现良好，即使如此， 12 月 14 日至 1 月 14 日之间，很少项目的底价（2.27 ETH 至 11.5 ETH）增长可以接近 600%（MAYC：4.8 至 14.25 = 200%；BAYC：58.1至 100 = 72%）。\n\n不过在接下来的 2 周内，底价回撤至 9 ETH，然后在 1 月 26 日再次起飞，并在 2 月 1 去到了 16.9 ETH 的新ATH。\n\n此后，底价保持相对稳定，2 月和 3 月的大部分时间都在 10-15 ETH 范围内，有几次短暂下跌至 8 ETH，并去到了 17.5 和 19.5 ETH 的 2 个新 ATH。 2 月和 3 月的大部分时间是 NFT 总交易量急剧下降的时期，许多项目陷入困境，所有蓝筹项目都经历了很多缩水。\n\nDoodles 在此期间的稳定表现，明显与大多数其他项目背道而驰，许多人更视 Doodles 为未来的一个看涨的指标。正如预测的那样，Doodles 非常强劲地走出了这个看跌期，创下 19.5 ETH 的高位，同期，其他顶级项目也表现强劲。\n\n5 月 1 日，Doodles 开始大幅上涨，首次突破 20 ETH，并在 5 月 5 日到了 26 ETH的ATH。\n\n这个夸张的上涨在当时非常不可思意，直到今天仍然如此。不但在暴涨之前没有任何重大公告，事实上，在之前的一个多月里，discord 中根本没有任何公告。虽然在5 月 5 日，Doodles 宣布他们将发布一个重大公告，以及来年的 4 个全球品牌亮相的计划，但这实际上标志着上涨的的顶部，而不是一个领先指标。\n\n次日，Doodles 宣布任命 Julian Holguin 为新任 CEO，并在 6 天后的 5 月 12 日空投「神秘装置」\n\nDooplicator 空投之前，Doodles底价保持在 19 ETH 左右，之后，那些自称有 Dooplicator 的Doodles，底价回落至 14 ETH 左右。\n\n自推出以来，Dooplicator 底价非常稳定地保持在 3 ETH 左右（除了市场最糟糕的日子）\n\n在此期间，Doodles 的底价主要保持在 10-12 ETH 之间，NFT 市场整体上陷入了巨大的困境，加密货币和其他资产类别更大幅崩盘，宏观经济前景黯淡。因此，在这次市场低迷期间，Doodles的底价相当强劲地保持在 14 ETH 左右。\n\n\n自推出以来，Doodles 非常强劲且持续增长，已牢牢确立了自己在 NFT 项目的顶级地位。在不同市场环境下的表现，都是领先状态，即使对比起其他最受好评的项目，也是如此。\n评分 9.75/10\n自推出以来的行动NFT.NYC 2021\n在推出 Doodles 的 1 周内，创始人准备了大约 22.6 ETH，用来在 NFT.NYC 2021 上展示该品牌，NFT.NYC是 NFT 和 web3领域中重要的文化活动，以展示 web2/web3 品牌如何在本地和社区中部署有效实惠的营销活动。\n\nMiami Art Basel 2021由社区提议和投票的营销、品牌和数字化体验活动，创始人从 Doodlebank 总共准备了 137.63 ETH，完成了以下事项：\n\n位于迈阿密温伍德 ，占地40,000 平方英尺的Burnt Toast壁画\n\nHeart Basel 派对，邀请了 Gunna, Amine, A-trak, Dave1, D33J, ASAP Nast作演出嘉宾\n\n6,000 多名参加者在参加 Heart Basel 艺术展，展示 Geronimo 的落地充气展品\n\n为Doodles品牌赢得数百万曝光的新Doodles持有者：Future、Gunna、Steve Aoki、Dillon Francis、Rich the Kid、Fat Joe 等。\n\nDoodles 定制时装首次亮相私人零售商活动\n\n在 Doodles Miami HQ 与创始人、艺术家和艺人建立关系\n\nSnapchat 合作伙伴 ft. Doodles 定制Snapchat Lens（MVP — V2 正在开发中）\n\n具有 200 万次地理定位曝光的 Snapchat Lens 收购广告活动\n\nSnapchat 体验合作 ft. AR-experience live Burnt Toast Doodles Mural\n\n赢得媒体报道：超过 1 亿次跨平台曝光、Hypebeast 报导和 Coinbase 报导。持续的报道请求。\n\n\n非稀释第二空投：Space Doodles:\nSpace Doodles 是 Doodles 的第二次空投，持有者免费获得。 Space Doodles 的出现是一个非常有趣的现象，与 BAYC 和 CryptoKitties 的突变/繁殖不同。\n\n它的运作方式是先由 Doodles Bot 智能合约包装 Doodles NFT，并生成一个 Space Doodle，再发到持有者的钱包，而 Bot 的保险库会保存原始 Doodle。持有者可以根据需要，多次打开和重新包装他们的 Doodles，并且可以以出售任何一种Doodle（但不能同时出售 - 出售已包裹或未包裹的 Doodles NFT 意味着您也不再持有另一个）。\n\n创始人声称改进了现有的 NFT 包装技术——这是他们自己首次与 Crytokitties 一起引入的概念\n\nSpace Doodles 是种动画，以原始的Doodles在宇宙飞船内的形式亮相。持有人手上 Doodles 的稀有度和特征，衍生出Space Doodles稀有度、特征和等级都会有所不同\n\nSpace Doodle 有不同的级别（区域、最近的行星、推进剂、驾驶能力、机械知识等），暗示未来有机会推出游戏应用。众所周知，这些统计数据可以用某种形式，结合未来的体验中\n\nSpace Doodles 是一次有趣的二次空投。虽然它没有为持有者创造多一个NFT，不可以同时卖出两个NFT，但它有效地增加了稀缺性。而由于智能合约不同，这两个项目独立在不同的市场上交易\n\n通过基于持有人原先有的 Doodle 衍生出的Space Doodles ，为持有者提供了从本质上重新选择手上NFT稀有度的机会，提供了获得更稀有物品的新机会，同时不会降低现有 Doodle 的价值\n\n\n同伴空投：Dooplicator:Dooplicator 空投是在可以拎取前的几天才宣布，一直没有透露有关的消息，只透露了以下信息：\n\n这是一款只有背包那么大的设备，它具有非凡的功能，可用于我们的下次的主要产品发布中。我们会在 NFT NYC 期间，在我们的预告片首映上播出有关它的影片。\n里面有什么呢？我们现在只能说它正在生成模糊的 Doodley 物质。特性和稀有度将于 6 月 23 日揭晓。\n\n\n\n空投领取期，是在 NFT.NYC 2022 公布其用途的前一天结束。它的作用，会在今年夏天的某个时间开始「Dooplication (有「复制」的同音)」。\n关于 Dooplicator 将会做什么的讨论比比皆是，但通过 Evan Keast 在 VeeCon 2022 上的演讲，我们估计出一些可能方向：\n\n如果他们可以回到过去，Doodles

是什么，我们都期待它具有创新性并再次突破界限。\n不过，「Dooplication」也有机会存在过度饱和的风险，特别是如果 Dooplicated 项目与 Doodle NFT 的区别不够大，就会有很大问题，因为这样的话可能会对原始 Doodles 的价值产生负面影响。\n不过又不过，团队肯定都会意识到这种问题的出现，我们希望「Dooplication」的设计对这一点有深思熟虑。\n\n未来的

在无而需融资下，现有的资金足够维持他们运作 1-2 年。至今，Doodles 系列在市场不论好坏的情况下，二手买卖市场的销售量都领先于其他蓝筹项目，因此对于它们未来的版税收入，您可以相当有信心。\n风险投资公司Seven Seven Six在 Doodles 的 NFT.NYC 2022 发布会上宣布，他们将领导 Doodles 的第一轮融资，为该品牌提供大量额外资源，以支持Doodles 执行其雄心勃勃的计划\n如果Doodles可以有其他层面的收入来源，会更好\n\n项目在经济层面表现得非常透明，二手买卖市场强劲的销售量，也为它带来稳定的收入来源。由此可见，Doodles在经济层面上，是处于非常有利的位置。而一个可能的改善之处，是建立其他层面的收入来源。\n评分 9.25/10\n总评分

analysis phasesThere are six data analysis phases that will help you make seamless decisions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Keep in mind, these are different from the data life cycle, which describes the changes data goes through over its lifetime. Let’s walk through the steps to see how they can help you solve problems you might face on the job.\n\nStep 1: AskIt’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:\n\nDefine the problem you’re trying to solve \nMake sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations\nFocus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions\nCollaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication\nTake a step back and see the whole situation in context\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nWhat are my stakeholders saying their problems are?\nNow that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?\n\n\nStep 2: PrepareYou will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: \n\nWhat metrics to measure\nLocate data in your database\nCreate security measures to protect that data\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nWhat do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?\nWhat research do I need to do?\n\n\nStep 3: ProcessClean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:\n\nUsing spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data \nUsing SQL functions to check for extra spaces\nRemoving repeated entries\nChecking as much as possible for bias in the data\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nWhat data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?\nHow can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?\n\n\nStep 4: AnalyzeYou will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: \n\nPerform calculations\nCombine data from multiple sources\nCreate tables with your results\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nWhat story is my data telling me?\nHow will my data help me solve this problem?\nWho needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?\n\n\nStep 5: ShareEveryone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team: \n\nMake better decisions\nMake more informed decisions\nLead to stronger outcomes\nSuccessfully communicate your findings\n\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nHow can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?\nWhat would help me understand this if I were the listener?\n\n\nStep 6: ActNow it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.\nQuestions to ask yourself in this step:\nHow can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?\n\nThese six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:\n\nRecognizing the current problem or situation\nOrganizing available information \nRevealing gaps and opportunities\nIdentifying your options\n\nWhen you are starting out in your career as a data analyst, it is normal to feel pulled in a few different directions with your role and expectations. Following processes like the ones outlined here and using structured thinking skills can help get you back on track, fill in any gaps and let you know exactly what you need.\n","tags":["Notes","Data Analysis"]},{"title":"How to solve problems?","url":"/2022/09/12/How-to-solve-problems/","content":"How to solve problems? (TBC)Nowadays, people are hired not only to realize functions, but more to solve problems. Besides that, in personal life, we are around by various problems. One day, if we are given a problem, how to solve it effectively? And how to be a good problem solver?\n1.  Types of ProblemsBefore rushing into how to solve problems, let’s start with the types of problems.\n\nThis idea is coming form Problem-Solving: The Owner’s Manual by Pierce Howard, which can be combined with Bohn’s talking about the link between causes and effects in class. Figure 1 shows the types of problems with the general activities to solve them in blue rectangles. Problems can be divided into two parts: solutions are known and unknown. In the first part where solutions are known, the ideal type is the best solution to a problem is obvious based on complete knowledge, then we implement it. If the best solution is not obvious, where we have solutions with certain outcomes, then we should compare and decide one best solution. Sometimes, we have solutions with uncertain outcomes. What we must react is to decide which solution has the highest probability of success. One example here can be how to choose the best design of the garden for maximum residents’ satisfaction. If the potential solutions are in a jumbled list without priority, what we do can be determining the priority order based on the effects. But complete knowledge situation rarely happens. Most times problems come in a way we are not familiar with. If the cause is unknown, the first thing we should do is finding the cause. If the cause is known or irrelevant, we can generate ideas that could fix the problem. So, the messages to take can be different based on the types of problems, which depends on our state of knowledge. \n2.  The process to solve problemsProblem solving is a process, consisting of 4 key stages, which can be divided to problem definition, solutions generation, evaluating and choosing best solution, and solution validation.\n\nFigure 2: 4 stages to solve problems\nTo solve problem effectively and creatively, the first stage should be defining the problem we want to solve. Identify the stakeholders who have a say in the way we solve this problem and what they want. Then describe the vision which should include is the trouble trying to solve now. By asking whys to get the potential root causes we need to address. Then try to write down what we want to achieve in the future. Sometimes we can even get the key factors based on prior knowledge and experience. Some tools may help a lot here, like fishbone diagram to the causes. Some people tend to answer the first problem without checking if this is the right we really want to solve.\nIn the next stage, generating solutions. After discovering the real problem that we really want to solve, try to concentrate on generating many solutions such as a target 20 potential alternatives and should not evaluate them at all. Many times, an idea that would have been thrown away immediately, if evaluating properly, can develop into an excellent solution.\nThe third stage should be evaluating and choosing the best solution. In evaluating step, some constraints should be taken into consideration like cost, safety, policy, etc. Write the good points and bad points of every solution and state the unique point after looking through all the constraints and targets for all potential solutions. Sometimes, numbers and facts will help us decide the final solutions if the solution can show certain outcomes. For solutions with uncertain outcomes, decision to the best one may be made by feeling, which can be the result of our skills, experience, and knowledgement, place in the right limiting circumstance. Some tools like SWOT can help us to shortlist our potential choices. Besides that, we can also ask our team members for voting. If all the solutions cannot meet the needs, we may go back to the start of the cycle to check the problem statement and go the journey again.\nThe last stage should be validating the final solution. The beginning of this stage is deciding how we will make the solution happen. Testing will be made serval times and confirming that the solution has been carried out as planned. Ask our stakeholders’ feedbacks and evaluate the results. Then make the next plan to improve and integrate.\n3.  How to be a creative problem solver?After learning how to apply different models and tools to solve problems, maybe we can solve new problems we are not familiar, but can we always get a creative and effective solution? The answer is no. But we can always get useful solutions by developing our personality traits. \nAfter the journey to understand what creativity is, I was totally attracted by these brilliant artists and innovators, leading me on a trip to discover what makes us creative, where ideas come from, and how they come to life.\nCreativity is the ability to see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour. (William Blake) The ability to perceive and produce novel ideas or products that are useful to society. Creativity is the art of problem solving.\n\nFigure 3 shows the 4 stages of creativity and problem solving.\nThe process starts with preparation, which is all about gathering information. In this stage, we gather related information and materials by conducting users research and empathize with them in order to get the real pain points and define the problem. At this stage, we can use a variety of ideation methods to understand and build problems and ideas from various angles.\nStage 2 is incubation, where let mind wander. After collecting information in stage 1, take a step away from the ideas before working on them. Open your mind to all ideas unconsciously, and new connections come slowly.\nNext comes the illumination, where shows Eureka. After a period of incubation, insights arise from the deeper layers of the mind, and the ideas show up suddenly. It’s the sudden Eureka moment! \nThe fourth stage is about verification and production. Following the Eureka moment, ideas enter your mind and it’s time to evaluate, test, develop, and verify them. At this stage, you will prototype and test your idea to see if it meets the user needs defined in the preparation stage, get feedbacks and learning, then polish it up.\nFrom these 4 stages, the creativity process oscillates between convergent and divergent thinking. Incubation and illumination are about inspiration, whereas preparation and validation are about generation. To go forward, we should seek the balance between dreaming and doing. Personal traits will show how we will perform the choice. For example, doers will shine in the preparation and verification stages, and dreamers will be the stars in incubation and illumination stages. If you are a doer, sometimes you may find you can really get things done in a brilliant way but lack the new ideas since focusing on the productivity. For a long-term growth, you can read, travel, meet different people, and open your mind to different views. Clean out the space for dream and imagination. For dreamers, who may be stuck too much in their marvelous ideas, try to practice more and apply the skills into real world. \nQuote to end, ‘Know thyself’. We are on a lifelong journey to learn and grow.\n","tags":["Notes"]},{"title":"THE LEAN PRODUCT PROCESS","url":"/2022/09/12/THE-LEAN-PRODUCT-PROCESS/","content":"THE LEAN PRODUCT PROCESSThe Lean Product Playbook written by Dan Olsen shows a detailed guide on how to find product markets and make products people love. Unlike some books that are long in theory and short in practice, this is the first book I’ve read that really explains how to apply Lean Startup concepts in a practical, step-by-step manner. I’m so glad to have the book when I have the passion to build something inspired. \nAnd this note is more about listing some topics I really love in this book.\nCore conceptsThe journey starts with why products failed and followed by the product-market fit, which captures the essence of what it means to build a great product. \n\nProduct-market fit:\nMy definition of product-market fit…is that you have to build a product that creates significant customer value. This means that your product meets real customer needs and does so in a way that is better than the alternatives.\n\nI used to pay more attention to some ideas or concepts like advertisement, marketing, business models, and how to increase the customer lifetime value, and this definition tells me there is a distinction between creating and capturing values in the process. In order to capture values, you have to create it first.\nThe other core concept in this book is the Problem Space and Solution Space. \n\nAny product that you actually build exists in solution space, as do any product designs that you create—such as mockups, wireframes, or prototypes.\nProblem space is where all the customer needs that you’d like your product to deliver live.\n\nAnd the customer needs can be expanded to some other concepts like job-to-be-done, customer desires, or customer pain points. I attained many courses who starts with idetifying the job-to-be-done, which emphasizes the importace of finding what not be done or well to solve customers real problems. And sometimes I find that some blogs or books often talk about the differences between the “what” versus the “how.” The “what” describes the benefits that the product should give the customer—what the product will accomplish for the user. The “how” is the way in which the product delivers the “what” to the customer. The “how” is the design of the product and the specific technology used to implement the product. “What” is problem space and “how” is solution space.\nThe Lean product processThe content of product management process can be divided into these steps:\n\nDetermine your target customers. This is the bottom of our pyramid since different customers will have different needs and even those who have the same needs may have different views on their relative importance. \n\nIdentify underserved customer needs. Before we mover to design a solution, we have to validate the job-to-be-done, customer pain points or customer desires. Since customer needs can seem somewhat fuzzy when we interview them, and they are not skilled at describe the roots of the problem.\n\nDefine your value proposition. At this point, we have identified several important customer needs, now we need to decide which ones our product or service will address. \n\nSpecify your MVP feature set. Now we have a clear understanding of our value proposition, we have decided on the feature set for our MVP, identifying functionality required to validating we are heading on the right direction.\n\nCreate your MVP prototype. At this stage, we want to create a user experience or prototype that we can show to customers so that we can test our ideas.\n\nTest your MVP with customers. In this part, we conduct both qualitative and quotative user test to see how it compares to the target value. \n\nThen Iterate to improve product-market fit. I learned a loop called ‘build-measure-learn’, which means we want to use what we have learned after we receive a round of feedbacks to modify our hypotheses and MVP so that we can test them with customers again. We want to iterate quickly with the goal of improving product-market fit.\n\n\nSome tasks will be performed in these steps:\n\nUnderstanding and representing user needs.\n\nDefining a vision for a product.\n\nMonitoring the market and developing competitive analyses.\n\nAligning stakeholders around the vision for the product.\n\nPrioritizing product features and capabilities.\n\nCreating a shared brain across larger teams to empower independent decision-making.\n\n\nThere are some benefits of Lean or agile management. First, because we are planning in smaller increments, we can react to changes in the market or new information more quickly. Second, our product can reach customers earlier, which means that we can start hearing feedbacks from customers on our actual products sooner, which helps guide our subsequent product management efforts. Third, teams can reduce their margin of error in estimating scope by working in smaller batch sizes.\nTBC… Some concepts in Agile will be added, and some tools will be here in the future after I have the experience of the whole loop. Some other ideas can be the link and differences between design thinking and the lean product process.

I always look at funding first. If a project has no runway in a bear market it’s dead in the water. It’s a challenge to dig up these answers sometimes but my first steps are always Google and ask the team directly on their Telegram or Discord.\nDo they have enough capital in their treasury for at least two years’ runway?\nIs their treasury held in fiat, stable or their own token? Example, FTX and its token FTT.\nDo they have access to their treasury or is it vested?\nDo they earn fiat outside of crypto?\nWill their revenue grow as the project scales?\n\n\nTeam. The infomation of team members can be found in their websites, socials, twitter, and LinkedIn. And the telegram channel and discord can be a good place to ask more questions about the project and team members. Sometimes the team can make great difference on the project. The xen was very popular when it first introduced to the market and there was a gas war since the founder is the No.21 in Google. \nDoes the team have relevant experience?\nIs their team large enough for a project of their size?\nIs the CEO still active and does he/she appear to care?\nAre they actively hiring?\n\n\nThe developers in the team. Check LinkedIn for previous dev experience and @Artemis__xyz to see how active they are on GitHub. If they aren’t on Artemis you can check GitHub directly. How recent a commit is is more important than overall commit frequency though! The other reason why this is important is one of the biggest challenges in the crypto world is the code, since crypto and web3 are building on the trust and the coding is the fundemental of the safety. Hackers Already Profit Billions Dollars From Code Vulnerabilities.\nAre the devs active? (check GitHub)\nDo the devs have blockchain experience?\n\n\nTokenomics - Basic info can be found in their whitepaper.\nAre team and advisor wallets locked for at least 6 months?\nIs liquidity locked for at least 2 years?\nIf the token is unreleased has it been actively traded OTC by presale investors?\nIf the token is released, is it fully distributed?\nIf not fully distributed is vesting structured to not cause massive dumps?\nIf not fully distributed what percentage of the Fully Diluted Value(FDV) has been hit and how long till 100%?\nIs token distribution good? (i.e. team &lt; 20%, advisors &lt;5%)\nAdd token unlock dates to your calendar!\n\n\nTokenomics - Value Accrual\nIs there a burning mechanism?\nDoes staking provide a high yield?\nIf yield is high is there a mechanism for fighting inflation?\nIs the locking of tokens incentivised?\nIf tokens aren’t locked are users encouraged to hold? Special function, like holding BNB can reduce middle fee when deposit and withdraw.\nIs there an escrow mechanism to reduce inflation like GMX’s eGMX?\nDo they pay out more than they make?\n\n\nTokenomics - Investors. Check the web, whitepaper and google the VCs.\nAre there any holders with over 5% of the supply who aren’t on the team?\nAre you able to identify non-team big holders and do they pose a risk?\nAre VCs invested and how long are they vested? (remember VCs can market buy)\n\n\nCommunity. Community is arguably more important than tokenomics. The value of the token is highly built on the trust. Bitcoin will be worthless if people don’t believe it. A lot of projects rally based on community alone. The only way to know if the community is strong is to spend time in their Telegram or Discord and see how good their Twitter engagement is. Examples: Shit, Doge. \nDo they have a genuine and large social following?\nDo they have good social media reach and engagement?\nDoes the marketing appear ethical?\nDo they communicate with their community?\nDo they have good and active mods on their TG/Discord?\nDoes their community appear strong and happy?\n\n\nUse Cases. Check their website and whitepaper for this. Use case is important for long-term growth. Bonus points if the use case is valid in a bear market.\nIs their tech new?\nDoes their tech address successfully solve problems?\nWhat is the market size for this tech and will grow?\nIs there a desire for this tech in the space?\nIs the tech scalable if this project were to grow?\nWill use cases still exist in an extended bear market?\nAre the use cases viable long-term or will they be easily replaced?\n\n\nRoadmap\nDoes their roadmap indicate they plan to keep building and improving?\nDoes the roadmap have realistic timeframes?\nAdd important milestones to your calendar.\n\n\nUsers, customer segment. Do the team update info often? Is the team active in the community? Are there positive vibes on Discord? Are haters shouted down by holders?\nDoes the team care about users?\nAre users loyal to the project?\n\n\nCompetitors Analysis\nDo they have a lot of competitors?\nDo they have an edge over competitors? Unique selling points.\nWhat risks do their competitors pose?\nDo they have a stronger community than their competitors?\nMaeket share.\nEntry Barries.\nCompetitors’ response.\n\n\nRisks. A lot of these can be answered while you are doing competitor research or answering questions in other categories. Whitepapers, websites, Telegram/Discord and general knowledge of the sector are all useful for answering these questions.\nAre there weaknesses that may prove critical?\nAre the team focused on building or making money?\nWhat are their biggest weaknesses and cant they realistically be overcome?\nWill an extended bear market affect the project?\nIs there a risk that regulation will kill the project? Chinese government killed the stepn project. \n\n\nCurrent Value. The fundmental analysis and technical analysis are important here.

And they have the ability to rally resources to make the roadmap sucessful.\nProduct development leader: They are response for organizing and motivting their team to hit the roadmap milestones.\nWhen working across groups, use the sales leader as the your business leader.\n\nCustomers researchThere are some question have to figure out:\n\nWhat decisions do your customer need to make in choosing your product?\nWhat problem are they trying to solve?\nWhat other options are available to them?\n\nAnd luckily,  there are some ways you can get to your customers:\n\nInitiate a research group.\nAsk your customer yourself like make an appointment, a phone call, a zoom meeting, etc. Reach out to your customers directly may be the best way to get insights.\nParticipate in sales or customer service meetings.\n\nStart with product strategyA product strategy describes how your company will achieve its business goals. And a product strategy should answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are your goals?\nHow will you measure your sucess?\nWho are your target customers? Who are you really want to win?\nWhat are the key needs of your target customers you want to meet?\nWhat benifit do you provide to customers?\nWho are your competitors?\nWhat options do your customers have? the alternatives?\nWhat is the key different between you and your competitors?\n\nDecision-making and building alignmentIdentify key milestones\n\nSome milestones may address the pain points of existing customers, increasing their usage and reduce the churn. And other milestones may allow your customers use your product in new ways. Some may even do not benifit your customers directly, like open new distribution channel, reducing costs.\n\nRecord the strategy objectives it supports.\nWhen you finished brainstorms your milestones, give it a priority and meet with your business leader. An one-to-one meeting may increase the chance they share true feedbacks.\n\nEstimate leves of effort\nFirst, estimate the development capacity of your team. It usually in the form of developer days, weeks, and months.\nThe next is estimate the development time for each milestones. One thing we have to know is not all time is spent on developping. It may cost plenty of time to fix bugs, maintain products, and engineering.\n\nBuilding the strawman —— the first version\nThe first step is to roughly sequence your milestones in terms of their value in supporting your product strategy.\nThe next step is to schedule these milestones into your roadmap. You can start with the most basic approach to scheduling. Look at your first, highest priority milestone. Use the effort estimate provided by your product development leader,as well as the development capacity of the team, to figure out when on the calendar you could expect it to be delivered.\nNext, you pick up the second highest priority milestone and assuming that the first one is completed on time, schedule that one in the same manner.\nOnce done, it may look like this.\n\n​        \n\nIf these milestones are for different products,  you may separate them like this.\n\nHere comes the product roadmap meeting\nExplain the goal\nQuickly review your product strategy \nReview the development capacity of your team\nWalk through your product roadmap strawman\nAsk the team waht they wish was different\nModify the roadmap directly, so everyone can see the consequences.\n\nThis process reminds me of the RACI chart, and get all the group members in a warm meeting.\n","tags":["PM","Notes","Lifelong_Learning"]},{"title":"Why I love Coursera","url":"/2022/08/03/Why-I-love-Coursera/","content":"What is my favourite application?Today, I realized I spent more than 10 hours on Coursera every week for the past year and I really enjoyed this platform. Coursera is a platform that you can build skills with online courses from top institutions and universities. I like it since I can learn a lot from top universities whenever and wherever I am, no time, places limits at a low cost or even free. I learnt a lot  courses on it and I really want to introduce it to you. \nHow did I know Coursera?I still remember the first time I met Coursera when I was learning Deep Learning taught by Andrew Ng, who was a famous professor in Stanford University. At the end of his class in deeplearning.ai, he would introduce us Coursera created by Daphne Koller and himself. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) was bringing educational and vocational courses online and Coursera totally won my fragemental time on PC. Similarly, Weixin Reading introduced online reading to the public in China, and became the most visited app on my phone when I was free. \nWhat is the customer journey map?The general process of an individual user can be divided into the following steps.\n\nLog in as individual user or enterprise users\nFind the courses you want by searching jobs, skills, or universities\nRead the introduction of the course and enroll\nTake the course with your customize schedule\nTake all discussions, tests, peer value, and quiz\nEarn a certificate provided by Coursera and institutions\nShare your learning and certificates to LinkedIn or other platforms\n\nBusiness model of CourseraWho are the customers? (Customer Segments)Coursera provides services to two main kinds customer segments. The first one is educational institutions like universitties and companies, which wants to share course resources with a fully access. The other one can be the end-users who want to learn some skills in specific fields but may find it difficult to get access to educational resources. \nThe following types of people can be their potential end-users:\n\nHigh school students who want to take college courses in advance.\nCollege students who want to take online courses rather than offline courses.\nCollege students who want to learn extracurricular skills.\nFresh graduate students who want to decide or change career path.\nPeople who already have a job want to strengthen their existing knowledge.\nPeople who already have jobs and want to learn new skills.\n\nTry to imagine this scenario: more and more people realize the importance of life-long learning. As a fresh graduate, Allen is pursuing  a full-time job related to product management, business development. For a better fit, he chooses courses related to digital product managemt, Data analysis, and project managemtn on Coursera and spends 10 hours per week on it. \nWhat value does Coursera deliver to customers? (Value Propositions)When it comes to what customer needs Coursera want to satisfy, it allows end-users like me easy and complete access to top educational online resources that  many constomers may find unaffordable or inaccessable through its website and application.\nSharing high-level courses also means that universities and insititutions can reach a greater number of consumers more easily, futhering their individual brand identities. \nHow does Coursera make money? (Revenue Streams)Courserea starts its journey with the goal of providing high-level education resources for free to anyone looking for it. Now, Coursera charges from several channels to improve its services. \nFree accessThere are many ways to get access to some courses for free since some courses are provided to everyone for free. Besides that,  people can choose audition when choose whether to pay for the course so that  they still have access to most course materials for this course without a certificate.\nCertificatesMost courses are offered with no charge. However, people who want to earn a certificate of completion which is a trusted and shareable way to showcase their new skills can choose to pay the course fee. This feature was landed in 2013, giving paying students access to graded assignments, homework, and examinations. If completed satisfactorily, they can earn a verified certificate at the end of the course, and they can visit the course in the future with no limits. The course fee varies between from $39 to $89 depending on the course. Nowadays, people can choose to be a membership with no limits to a sea of courses at a cost of $39 per month. \nIf you have planty time during some period so that you can finish the course within the7-days trail, once finished, you can also get the certificate and have no limits when revisit the course in the future.\nSpecializationsThis feature is a bundle of different but related courses designed to help customers  deepen their expertise in a specific area. For example, DeFi: The future Finance Specialization consisted of 4 courses aims to provide learners a much deeper understanding of both the infrastructure of DeFi and leading applications. Customers can pay monthly subscription fees between $39 to $89, depending on the specialization, for access to all resources and specialization certificates.\nCoursera for BusinessCoursera for Business enables businesses to offer their employees or teams access to a sea of courses to boost their expertise. Compared to traditional certificates, Coursera provides this service with a lower fee of $400 per employee per year. Enterprise packages comes with higher cost than personal or teams’ plan. Coursera for Campus provides silimar option to the government and universities.\nSince higher price and growing customers in this segment, it has quickly become a key channel of revenue.\nUniversity DegreesCollaborated with top universities world wide, Coursera offers students a chance to complete a fully recognized Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree, including MBA from UIUC. The price is far lower compared to degrees in campus, but with the same instructors who teach in person. Scholarships are provided. It’s reported that Coursera generated $12.0M in revenue in Q1, 2021 with 13,493 students enrolled. \nCompetitve analysisSWOT AnalysisStrength\nStrong relationships with its key partners to offer colourful and high-level courses.\nFirst-move advantages: kind of becoming market standard. After Coursera, many universities or educational angency like MOOC China, and MIT opensource, built their own platform which follows these standards. What’s more, the earlier Coursera ran into the market, the bigger market share it would take. Some MOOC platforms like Xue Tang Zai Xian created by Chinese government and universities has limited market usually in domestic rather than a golbal market. \nGood environment to spread courses. Multi-lanuage courses are provided to learners from all over the world. At the same time, Coursera advocates learners to take part in translation event so that subttitle will be translate into their mother language and would be offered after reviews.\nDiverse revenue channels. Multiple revenue model enables Couresera great resources to not only keep competitve to the threat of newcomers but also invest into R&amp;D.\n\nWeakness\nServices Coursera provided are more focus on solution space, which means more about what can they do. Sometimes they ignore the interests of external stakeholders.\nPoor visual design. Terrible design on both Andriod and iPhone.\n\nOpportunities\nCovid-19 has changed many people’s lifestyle. Some universities promoted hybrid teaching model, and sea of students were trying to get access to online learning. Even after Covid, people really enjoy online learning since they can follow their own schedule.\nGlobalization enables Coursera more international markets. Growth in international market can also help Coursera diversify the risk as it will be less dependent on domestic market for revenue.\nTechnology empowering more possibilities. With the development and application of Machine Learning and AI, more smart features including recommendation can be offered to keep customers active.\n\nThreats\nGovernment Regulations. Coursera should keep a close eye on the fast changing government regulations under the growing conflicts environment .\nCustomers are moving toward mobile  which can hamper the growth as Coursera  still hasn’t got a comprehensive mobile strategy.\n\nWhat can be improved?Nice improvements from my experiencesAs a customer, although Coursera provides great services,  for more effience and easy of use, some nice improvments can be the following:\n\nA calendar that shows due dates for assignments and quizzes across all of your courses. When I signed up for 3-4 classes, it’s hard to keep track of what is due and when. Optional email reminders would be a nice touch.\n\nQuick feedbacks and colorful interations to keep users active. Solving small but not so primitive tasks by students could help feeling the progress. And the more types of such quizzes are presented (not just a multiple choice), the more learners will be willing to join. What’s more, peer value and discussion can be offered for students to communicate more to help each other so that they will spend more time on it to get a better understanding and build the willing to learn other related courses.\n\nBetter interaction design on Mobile application. A terrible journey starts when open Coursea on both Android and iPhone. It’s difficult for me to get what I want.\n\nBetter recommendation performance. Sometimes, after finishing one course, if learners want a deep understanding of specific field, a good recommendation at the end of learning will keep them engaged.\n\n\nMore testing should be conducted so that we can learn from the feedbacks from users and provide higher-perforance services.\nFuture planSome plans can be taken into consideration for further marketing.\n\nConduct geographic analysis to move to new markets.\nConduct IP analysis to keep competition out of the door.\n Invest more in building an easy-use mobile application.\nKeep existing customers active so that improve their customers life value. Some nice try can be introducing a new product or service of Coursera to existing customers, improving interaction and visual design.\nImprove customer loyalty of Coursera Coursera’s customers. Marketing efforts can be used to increase loyalty among existing customers by organizing events, and by providing post purchase information and services.\nIncrease brand awareness. Features like stronger and multiple sharing channels can reach new audiences on social media. What’s more, newcomers have a better chance of choosing a course through a friend’s recommendation.\n\nMore info and market analysis should be conducted to build a good strategy. Will be added soon.\nThank you for your time : )","tags":["PM","Business Model"]},{"title":"如何在Mac上使用Hexo开启博客之旅","url":"/2022/01/12/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%9C%A8Mac%E4%B8%8A%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Hexo%E5%BC%80%E5%90%AF%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E4%B9%8B%E6%97%85/","content":"之前使用了搭建在阿里云的轻量级服务器中的WordPress开启了我的第一个博客，可是由于使用起来体验不好，困扰我的可能有以下几点：\n\n使用阿里云轻量级服务器的过程中，一直出现服务器或数据库连接错误的情况。\n在国内的域名需要备案，出国后就希望能够开启一个比较宽松自由的风格。\n我的需求很简单，只是需要有个简洁的地方写点小东西罢了，倘或碰巧被你看见了，那便是我的幸运吧。虽然WordPress可以提供非常丰富的功能，但是嘞，对我来说有些 ‘乱花渐欲迷人眼’。\n\n于是转到了使用Hexo + Github Pages的静态博客组合，简单明了。\n什么是Hexo呢？Hexo 是一个快速、简洁且高效的博客框架。嗯，有道理，我喜欢。感兴趣的可以在官网上自行查看更多介绍。\n如何配置环境安装 Hexo 相当简单，只需要先安装下列应用程序即可：\n\nNode.js \n使用使用 Homebrew安装\n$ brew install node\nGit\n使用 Homebrew, MacPorts 或者下载 安装程序。\n$ brew install git\n\n\n安装Hexo\n所有必备的应用程序安装完成后，即可使用 npm 安装 Hexo。\n$ npm install -g hexo-cli\n\n如何搭建博客\n在你喜欢的地方建立一个名字为 ‘blog’ 的文件夹（名字也可按你喜欢的来）\n\n进入blog文件夹：cd blog\n\n初始化：hexo init\n\n启动Hexo：hexo s\n之后会出现一个默认的博文，浏览器输入：http://localhost:4000，便可查看。\n\n新建一篇博文：hexo n &#39;如何在Mac上使用Hexo开启博客之旅&#39;\n\n\n\n​    接下来就在自己喜欢的编辑器里编写吧，我自己使用过Vscode、Typora、以及Obsidian等来写Markdown以及管理自己的笔记。个人推荐Typora：界面简洁，所见即所得。Typora最近开始收费喽，大家看看自己的荷包吧，Obsidian目前仍然免费，但是功能强大，适合建立自己的知识网络，用来写博客是在大材小用。\n\n在写完后，同样进入到blog文件夹下，运行\n清理：hexo clean\n启动：hexo g\n生成：hexo s\n\n再次进入http://localhost:4000，便可查看你写好的博客了\n\n\n\n到这里搭建博客就已经成功了，接下来是将博客部署到Github上\nHexo + Github\n**登录github：https://github.com，没账号的新建一个，新创建一个仓库New repository，仓库名必须为：昵称.github.io:**，输入描述，创建：\n\n\n\n​                在这里因为我已经创建过了，所以会显示已经存在账户。\n\n接着回答terminal中，crtl + c 结束之前的运行，依旧在blog文件夹下部署github的插件：npm install hexo-deployer-git --save\n\n接着更改blog文件夹下面**_config.yml**的配置，如下\n\n\n\n​        可以从这里复制：\ndeploy:  type: git  repo: https://github.com/AllenZhuer/AllenZhuer.github.io.git  branch: master\n\n\n最后回到terminal，使用 hexo d 将博客部署到远端。中间会让输入github密码，输入即可，后续部署完成，即可访问你的远端地址。例子就是这样的: https://allenzhuer.github.io/\n\n\n这里呢，由于我使用了主题可能会和你的页面有一些差异，不过也没有问题，接下来我们将开始部署主题。\n选个喜欢的主题吧\n最重要的就是选主题了：https://hexo.io/themes/， 超多主题随你选择。\n\n我选择的主题为 keep，里面有非常详细的介绍，请移步吧。\n\n铛铛，部署完主题后，别忘了它们：\n\n清理：hexo clean\n启动：hexo g\n生成：hexo s\n部署：hexo d\n部署之后，可能有一点点延迟，等一小会儿就行了，捏一捏桌子上的小黄鸭吧。\n如果在你的博客中发现图片加载较慢的问题，推荐一个图床平台 Picx , 希望能够帮到你。\n域名最后一步是购买一个自己喜欢的域名，因为我思来想去的域名已经被别人购买了，并且也没有抱有此博客被许多人看到的想法，所以域名购买暂时告一段落。等到哪天域名过期或者是想到新的域名再来继续更新吧。\n一些购买域名的网站推荐：NameCheap , Godaddy , Namesilo 等等。\n如果这篇博客恰巧被你看到并且对你有帮助的话，我将十分开心。\n","tags":["blog"]}]
